My concern about HAVs is how they will interact with emergency vehicles. Will they have the ability to detect both mechanical and electronic sirens? Will they be able to locate emergency vehicles and determine their direction and speed by doppler effect of sirens as human drivers do? Will they recognize emergency vehicles approaching if there is no audible warning, particularly unmarked vehicles and POVs with red or blue lights? Will HAVs be able to distinguish between the air horns of emergency vehicles as opposed to truckers using their air horns for emergency and non-emergency purposes? How will they distinguish between the flashing red lights of emergency vehicles and normal flashing red brake of turn signal lights? Will they be able to recognize emergency vehicles stopped in the roadway to protect active incident areas, or school buses allowing children to cross the street? How will HAVs respond when the detect an oncoming emergency vehicle, will they pull to the right and stop as some state laws require, or will they pull to the left when in a passing lane of a major highway? Will they be able to inch out of the way for emergency vehicles when traffic is stopped on the highway due to a crash ahead? Will there be a way for emergency vehicle operators to signal to HAVs how to respond in emergencies? Responding quickly and appropriately to emergencies and emergency vehicles is one of the higher level skills which drivers need. Although many drivers are distracted and perform poorly under these sudden unexpected changes, emergency vehicle operators are reasonably successful in conveying their urgency and engendering the necessary cooperation of other drivers. How do the designers plan for HAVs to perform these high level skills in times of life and death?

I anxiously look forward to a day with a self driving car and the moblitiy and economits benefits thwy will enable. My concern in the near term is the transition from human responsibilty to machine responsibility. Speaking for myeslf, once I beging to trust a technology I tend to start relying on it to do thing I once did. An example is a back up camera, for the longest time I did not look at the camera's image. Instead I would turn and look over my shoulder. Nowdays, I nearly 100% use the camera. The exception is whenthe camera is obstructed by dirt or snow. Which leads me back to my concern. Newer vehicles have multiple cameras to assist me as a driver, the more assistance they give me the more dependant Ibecome on them, and the less I rely on myself. When I think of my dirty backup camera (that I am to lazy to clean off when it is dirty), I am concerned that my other camera's are also getting dirty and can't perform thier intend purpose putting me and others in danger. The auto makers could probably use the windshield washer to clean the cameras somehow, but what about when I run out of the window cleaner? My wife's vehicle does not even notify her when the fluid is low. I like that were aiming high, but we shuld be certain the arrow is first knocked.

Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090

The exploration of developing automated or self-driving cars began in the 1920's and through the years various companies and universities have developed some sort of prototype. While innovation is a cornerstone of all developing societies, it is pertinent that innovation be kept under controlled protocols. If it were not so, then the innovators would run the gamut on creating whatever behooves them to feed self-interests that in most cases are filled with pathological idiocy. In modern times, the various innovators in the area of automated vehicles have professed interesting reasons for their pursuit of developing such vehicles. The President of Lyft, a ride-sharing service provider, indicated in an interview in the September 20, 2016 edition of USA Today that he wants to "drive community and not cars to be the center of our everyday life." Basically, it would not disturb him if the self-driving cars market were to displace workers like taxi drivers, bus drivers, parking lot attendants, auto repairmen, and auto repair shops. He wants to have an app-based-pay-as-you-go model which obviously would totally wipe out an entire segment of the banking and finance markets. That's another 4 million or more people out of work. It sounds like his idea of "community" is warped because there's no community if the people are unable to work to build up the community.

The CEO of Telsa indicated in an interview with Fortune magazine (December 21, 2015) that his ultimate goal is to have full autonomous vehicles on the road. Currently, his company has produced auto-pilot vehicles which requires the driver to have a hands-on experience. The driver of an auto-pilot enabled car is supposed to have their hands on the wheel but, apparently, that has been shown not to always be the case in video footage placed online showing some drivers even getting in the backseat while the car is on auto-pilot. Telsa's Elon Musk acknowledges in his master plan (https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux) that the cost of owning an autonomous vehicle may be out of reach for most of the masses but to make up for that he suggests that those who can't afford to own one will be able to hail a ride from his fleet of self-driving cars. So clearly his plan is to build a massive company with a bulk of civilization dependent upon his solar-powered self-driving cars. Albeit, he's correct that civilization must move away from its reliance on fossil fuel, but not at the cost of being more than 90% reliant on one company's innovation.

Google, the company who became rich over an internet search engine, has created a totally self-driving car that is designed for riding not driving, runs off an electric battery, and has sensors that supposedly detects foot traffic, cyclists, and other objects with software that classifies these objects based on their size, shape, and movement patterns. Google claims that the software even predicts what all the objects in view might do next. So, it's supposed to actually predict when a pedestrian will cross the street. What about if a child playing with a ball that goes into the street runs after it from between some parked cars? Unexpected incidents like this cannot possibly be part of the software's code. The reality is that these companies and their leaders are innovating toys for their plaything without regard to human productivity, jobs, driver safety, privacy rights, software and hardware breakdown, and the rise of artificial intelligence. Don't be foolish to think that the type of technology in these automated cars is minuscule compared to the kind of artificial intelligence that could take over from humanity. These automated vehicles are just the beginning. If the NHTSA was wise it would propagate regulations allowing for some restrictions on having total autonomous vehicles. The auto-pilot enabled model is the better choice with policy imputing responsibility upon the driver to take over when needed. The driver who wants to act irresponsibly and get in the backseat has to pay a fine just like drivers who speed over the limits. Let states have rights to intervene because it's at the local level where cars are driven.

As a 49 year old woman, I look forward to owning a self driving car. It represents future independence as I look forward to older age. I would like a completely automated car (no human intervention) that communicates with the transportation system and other cars. Thank you for considering my input.

Please work to obtain pre-market approval authority. This field of endeavor is much too fraught with potential safety hazards to allow underfunded start-ups and fly by nights to fill the roads with under tested technology to interact with the driving public it will have to share the road with for at least the first 5 decades or so. I do not much care if it serves as a barrier to startups or their equal to getting a toehold in the market. No one is allowed to sell an un-certified aircraft design and that has helped the aviation industry to achieve decent levels of safety, not that there isn't room for improvement. It might be a good idea to require a "black box" trip recorder to help accident investigators determine what happened in a crash. That might be a good idea for all new vehicles. As a driver who learned to drive in Cheboygan, Michigan, in a very snowy winter I have serious doubts about the ability of software engineers ability to anticipate all the hazards an auto is likely to encounter, especially during inclement weather. A possible strategy might be to limit early models to areas that never get snowed on or that never experience other severe weather events such as hurricanes and tornadoes. Even though I am an Electronics Engineer and dearly love technology, I am not much in favor of technology for the sake of technology. Perhaps we can define progress to mean that just because we CAN do a thing, it does not necessarily follow that we SHOULD do that thing. The preceding idea is not original with me.

NHTSA is definitely on the right path for dealing with a rapidly evolving technology. Government should help promote the growth and acceptance of technology, while providing a regulatory framework that is as flexible and innovative as the technology itself. This new approach of setting out guidelines is an admirable, and forward thinking methodology. I have a few suggestions that might be of assistance.

Don't underestimate the interaction with AI research and development. Artificial Intelligence is central to autonomous vehicles. But AI is not the whole story, there is also something called Composite Intelligence, or CI. CI, like autonomous vehicles, is already here. In fact it's been with us for quite some time. Composite intelligence is sort of half-way between human intelligence, and machine intelligence. Bank ATMs are a good example, they are a CI system. The machine does the counting, scanning, and handles the security, the human being provides decision making. Not just at the ATM, this is also true at the interbank network level, and internationally. People and machines are working together as a system. The machines do what the machines are good at, and people do what humans are good at. That's Composite Intelligence.

Without a doubt, some of the automated vehicles we're already seeing on our roads, and more we will soon be seeing, will be CI systems. The idea of the driver being in the car, but not actually driving all the time, that's also CI. As you move from Human Intelligence, toward full machine intelligence, and then to AI (AI being self aware, still many years off) we are going to pass through a sliding scale CI zone. At the start the "driver," or perhaps we should call this person sitting behind the wheel but not fully driving, the "monitor," will have to pay attention. But as the sliding scale progresses, the monitor will be able to talk on the phone, then read, and finally take a nap.

I would also suggest that NHTSA consider carving up the problem of automated vehicles in some technologically rational manner. Think about the different driving zones that exist, and the different modes. For different zones there should be different safety guidelines. For example: city streets are not limited access highways. There are residential neighborhoods, industrial neighborhoods, and different times of day, and varying weather conditions; these might be considered as different modes.

Different parts of the country also have a huge impact on the characteristics of the different driving environments. It's because terrain affects how our roads were initially engineered. The western deserts are a piece of cake: long straight highways that stretch for hundreds of miles with nary a rest stop. If we don't already have automated big rigs driving these highway zones, then something is wrong, and the developers need to step up their game. The point is this, one set of guidelines is a great start. Don't stop there! Find places where it is easier, and harder, to introduce automated vehicles. Identify the boundaries between zone, then customize your guidelines for each difficulty level. Invite industry to help you work out the details together.

Downtown traffic in New York City is probably the last place we should expect to see market penetration. Because that's probably going to require something very close to true AI. But there are lots of roads in America where automated cars and trucks could already be making a huge impact, pretty much all of rural America. Breaking the problem up helps move everything forward, technology and regulation both.

Get help from The Pentagon. The defense and aerospace industries have some amazing sensor technology. Stuff the commercial automated car folks may not even be aware of. Lots of classified stuff. Figure out how to work with them without compromising national security. I myself am currently developing full spectrum night vision. Not some grainey red or green computer generated image. Rather, a night vision experience, indistinguishable from normal daylight seeing. It's completely passive, and has zero electronics. It's purely optical technology, lenses, and mirrors. All real images operating at the speed of light, no CCD cameras, no computers. It's called "Smart Windshield Technology (TM)." In essence it is a mechanical cats eye. Even without automated cars, think how many lives could be saved if nobody ever had to drive in the dark ever again.

It's not just for humans either. Full spectrum night vision can provide software, and computers, with denser, richer, data sets.

As more fully detailed in the attached letter, we are concerned that current salesforce and consumer education about autonomous vehicle features is insufficent, and that the voluntary reporting recommended by the guidance is inadequate.

On May 10, 2014, our 16-year-old daughter was in her car, properly stopped at a red light behind another vehicle. A brand new Mercedes GL450 was coming down that neighborhood street on a test drive. The salesman did not understand the automated braking component of the adaptive cruise control system (Distronic Plus - a Level 1 autonomous feature). He had the customer set the cruise control at 40 mph in a 35 mph speed zone and told her not to touch the brakes - that the system would stop the car better than she could.

Their SUV slammed into our daughter's car at approximately 40 miles per hour, propelling her vehicle into the car stopped ahead of hers and then both of those vehicles into the active intersection. While we were fortunate that her airbags deployed and her seatbelt restrained her, she suffered a serious concussion, requiring weeks of isolation and months of therapy to regain her health. We were of course very thankful, though, because had the crash occurred even a few seconds before or after, the cars could also have been struck by crossing traffic with tragic results.

We are very aware of the wonderful potential safety benefits that increasingly automated features can bring to our roadways, and look forward to a future of more secure automotive travel. However, as our experience shows, this current situation of various manufacturers bringing a variety of different features to market can cause a lot of confusion. Moreover, there is no efficient ongoing way to ensure that data about crashes like these, brought about by confusion about autonomous features in the marketplace, are made known.
