Comment: My concern about HAVs is how they will interact with emergency vehicles. Will they have the ability to detect both mechanical and electronic sirens? Will they be able to locate emergency vehicles and determine their direction and speed by doppler effect of sirens as human drivers do? Will they recognize emergency vehicles approaching if there is no audible warning, particularly unmarked vehicles and POVs with red or blue lights? Will HAVs be able to distinguish between the air horns of emergency vehicles as opposed to truckers using their air horns for emergency and non-emergency purposes? How will they distinguish between the flashing red lights of emergency vehicles and normal flashing red brake of turn signal lights? Will they be able to recognize emergency vehicles stopped in the roadway to protect active incident areas, or school buses allowing children to cross the street? How will HAVs respond when the detect an oncoming emergency vehicle, will they pull to the right and stop as some state laws require, or will they pull to the left when in a passing lane of a major highway? Will they be able to inch out of the way for emergency vehicles when traffic is stopped on the highway due to a crash ahead? Will there be a way for emergency vehicle operators to signal to HAVs how to respond in emergencies? Responding quickly and appropriately to emergencies and emergency vehicles is one of the higher level skills which drivers need. Although many drivers are distracted and perform poorly under these sudden unexpected changes, emergency vehicle operators are reasonably successful in conveying their urgency and engendering the necessary cooperation of other drivers. How do the designers plan for HAVs to perform these high level skills in times of life and death?

Comment: I anxiously look forward to a day with a self driving car and the moblitiy and economits benefits thwy will enable. My concern in the near term is the transition from human responsibilty to machine responsibility. Speaking for myeslf, once I beging to trust a technology I tend to start relying on it to do thing I once did. An example is a back up camera, for the longest time I did not look at the camera's image. Instead I would turn and look over my shoulder. Nowdays, I nearly 100% use the camera. The exception is whenthe camera is obstructed by dirt or snow. Which leads me back to my concern. Newer vehicles have multiple cameras to assist me as a driver, the more assistance they give me the more dependant Ibecome on them, and the less I rely on myself. When I think of my dirty backup camera (that I am to lazy to clean off when it is dirty), I am concerned that my other camera's are also getting dirty and can't perform thier intend purpose putting me and others in danger. The auto makers could probably use the windshield washer to clean the cameras somehow, but what about when I run out of the window cleaner? My wife's vehicle does not even notify her when the fluid is low. I like that were aiming high, but we shuld be certain the arrow is first knocked.

Comment: Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090

The exploration of developing automated or self-driving cars began in the 1920's and through the years various companies and universities have developed some sort of prototype. While innovation is a cornerstone of all developing societies, it is pertinent that innovation be kept under controlled protocols. If it were not so, then the innovators would run the gamut on creating whatever behooves them to feed self-interests that in most cases are filled with pathological idiocy. In modern times, the various innovators in the area of automated vehicles have professed interesting reasons for their pursuit of developing such vehicles. The President of Lyft, a ride-sharing service provider, indicated in an interview in the September 20, 2016 edition of USA Today that he wants to "drive community and not cars to be the center of our everyday life." Basically, it would not disturb him if the self-driving cars market were to displace workers like taxi drivers, bus drivers, parking lot attendants, auto repairmen, and auto repair shops. He wants to have an app-based-pay-as-you-go model which obviously would totally wipe out an entire segment of the banking and finance markets. That's another 4 million or more people out of work. It sounds like his idea of "community" is warped because there's no community if the people are unable to work to build up the community.

The CEO of Telsa indicated in an interview with Fortune magazine (December 21, 2015) that his ultimate goal is to have full autonomous vehicles on the road. Currently, his company has produced auto-pilot vehicles which requires the driver to have a hands-on experience. The driver of an auto-pilot enabled car is supposed to have their hands on the wheel but, apparently, that has been shown not to always be the case in video footage placed online showing some drivers even getting in the backseat while the car is on auto-pilot. Telsa's Elon Musk acknowledges in his master plan (https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux) that the cost of owning an autonomous vehicle may be out of reach for most of the masses but to make up for that he suggests that those who can't afford to own one will be able to hail a ride from his fleet of self-driving cars. So clearly his plan is to build a massive company with a bulk of civilization dependent upon his solar-powered self-driving cars. Albeit, he's correct that civilization must move away from its reliance on fossil fuel, but not at the cost of being more than 90% reliant on one company's innovation.

Google, the company who became rich over an internet search engine, has created a totally self-driving car that is designed for riding not driving, runs off an electric battery, and has sensors that supposedly detects foot traffic, cyclists, and other objects with software that classifies these objects based on their size, shape, and movement patterns. Google claims that the software even predicts what all the objects in view might do next. So, it's supposed to actually predict when a pedestrian will cross the street. What about if a child playing with a ball that goes into the street runs after it from between some parked cars? Unexpected incidents like this cannot possibly be part of the software's code. The reality is that these companies and their leaders are innovating toys for their plaything without regard to human productivity, jobs, driver safety, privacy rights, software and hardware breakdown, and the rise of artificial intelligence. Don't be foolish to think that the type of technology in these automated cars is minuscule compared to the kind of artificial intelligence that could take over from humanity. These automated vehicles are just the beginning. If the NHTSA was wise it would propagate regulations allowing for some restrictions on having total autonomous vehicles. The auto-pilot enabled model is the better choice with policy imputing responsibility upon the driver to take over when needed. The driver who wants to act irresponsibly and get in the backseat has to pay a fine just like drivers who speed over the limits. Let states have rights to intervene because it's at the local level where cars are driven.

Comment: As a 49 year old woman, I look forward to owning a self driving car. It represents future independence as I look forward to older age. I would like a completely automated car (no human intervention) that communicates with the transportation system and other cars. Thank you for considering my input.

Comment: Please work to obtain pre-market approval authority. This field of endeavor is much too fraught with potential safety hazards to allow underfunded start-ups and fly by nights to fill the roads with under tested technology to interact with the driving public it will have to share the road with for at least the first 5 decades or so. I do not much care if it serves as a barrier to startups or their equal to getting a toehold in the market. No one is allowed to sell an un-certified aircraft design and that has helped the aviation industry to achieve decent levels of safety, not that there isn't room for improvement. It might be a good idea to require a "black box" trip recorder to help accident investigators determine what happened in a crash. That might be a good idea for all new vehicles. As a driver who learned to drive in Cheboygan, Michigan, in a very snowy winter I have serious doubts about the ability of software engineers ability to anticipate all the hazards an auto is likely to encounter, especially during inclement weather. A possible strategy might be to limit early models to areas that never get snowed on or that never experience other severe weather events such as hurricanes and tornadoes. Even though I am an Electronics Engineer and dearly love technology, I am not much in favor of technology for the sake of technology. Perhaps we can define progress to mean that just because we CAN do a thing, it does not necessarily follow that we SHOULD do that thing. The preceding idea is not original with me.

Comment: NHTSA is definitely on the right path for dealing with a rapidly evolving technology. Government should help promote the growth and acceptance of technology, while providing a regulatory framework that is as flexible and innovative as the technology itself. This new approach of setting out guidelines is an admirable, and forward thinking methodology. I have a few suggestions that might be of assistance.

Don't underestimate the interaction with AI research and development. Artificial Intelligence is central to autonomous vehicles. But AI is not the whole story, there is also something called Composite Intelligence, or CI. CI, like autonomous vehicles, is already here. In fact it's been with us for quite some time. Composite intelligence is sort of half-way between human intelligence, and machine intelligence. Bank ATMs are a good example, they are a CI system. The machine does the counting, scanning, and handles the security, the human being provides decision making. Not just at the ATM, this is also true at the interbank network level, and internationally. People and machines are working together as a system. The machines do what the machines are good at, and people do what humans are good at. That's Composite Intelligence.

Without a doubt, some of the automated vehicles we're already seeing on our roads, and more we will soon be seeing, will be CI systems. The idea of the driver being in the car, but not actually driving all the time, that's also CI. As you move from Human Intelligence, toward full machine intelligence, and then to AI (AI being self aware, still many years off) we are going to pass through a sliding scale CI zone. At the start the "driver," or perhaps we should call this person sitting behind the wheel but not fully driving, the "monitor," will have to pay attention. But as the sliding scale progresses, the monitor will be able to talk on the phone, then read, and finally take a nap.

I would also suggest that NHTSA consider carving up the problem of automated vehicles in some technologically rational manner. Think about the different driving zones that exist, and the different modes. For different zones there should be different safety guidelines. For example: city streets are not limited access highways. There are residential neighborhoods, industrial neighborhoods, and different times of day, and varying weather conditions; these might be considered as different modes.

Different parts of the country also have a huge impact on the characteristics of the different driving environments. It's because terrain affects how our roads were initially engineered. The western deserts are a piece of cake: long straight highways that stretch for hundreds of miles with nary a rest stop. If we don't already have automated big rigs driving these highway zones, then something is wrong, and the developers need to step up their game. The point is this, one set of guidelines is a great start. Don't stop there! Find places where it is easier, and harder, to introduce automated vehicles. Identify the boundaries between zone, then customize your guidelines for each difficulty level. Invite industry to help you work out the details together.

Downtown traffic in New York City is probably the last place we should expect to see market penetration. Because that's probably going to require something very close to true AI. But there are lots of roads in America where automated cars and trucks could already be making a huge impact, pretty much all of rural America. Breaking the problem up helps move everything forward, technology and regulation both.

Get help from The Pentagon. The defense and aerospace industries have some amazing sensor technology. Stuff the commercial automated car folks may not even be aware of. Lots of classified stuff. Figure out how to work with them without compromising national security. I myself am currently developing full spectrum night vision. Not some grainey red or green computer generated image. Rather, a night vision experience, indistinguishable from normal daylight seeing. It's completely passive, and has zero electronics. It's purely optical technology, lenses, and mirrors. All real images operating at the speed of light, no CCD cameras, no computers. It's called "Smart Windshield Technology (TM)." In essence it is a mechanical cats eye. Even without automated cars, think how many lives could be saved if nobody ever had to drive in the dark ever again.

It's not just for humans either. Full spectrum night vision can provide software, and computers, with denser, richer, data sets.

Comment: See attached file(s)

As more fully detailed in the attached letter, we are concerned that current salesforce and consumer education about autonomous vehicle features is insufficent, and that the voluntary reporting recommended by the guidance is inadequate.

On May 10, 2014, our 16-year-old daughter was in her car, properly stopped at a red light behind another vehicle. A brand new Mercedes GL450 was coming down that neighborhood street on a test drive. The salesman did not understand the automated braking component of the adaptive cruise control system (Distronic Plus - a Level 1 autonomous feature). He had the customer set the cruise control at 40 mph in a 35 mph speed zone and told her not to touch the brakes - that the system would stop the car better than she could.

Their SUV slammed into our daughter's car at approximately 40 miles per hour, propelling her vehicle into the car stopped ahead of hers and then both of those vehicles into the active intersection. While we were fortunate that her airbags deployed and her seatbelt restrained her, she suffered a serious concussion, requiring weeks of isolation and months of therapy to regain her health. We were of course very thankful, though, because had the crash occurred even a few seconds before or after, the cars could also have been struck by crossing traffic with tragic results.

We are very aware of the wonderful potential safety benefits that increasingly automated features can bring to our roadways, and look forward to a future of more secure automotive travel. However, as our experience shows, this current situation of various manufacturers bringing a variety of different features to market can cause a lot of confusion. Moreover, there is no efficient ongoing way to ensure that data about crashes like these, brought about by confusion about autonomous features in the marketplace, are made known.

Comment: It is imperative that people continue to be able to get where they need to go via non-motorized modes. Please continue to preserve the rights and mobility of people who choose to not use motorized transportation (or cannot use it) in any subsequent law or policy.
I appreciate the attention to non-motorized users' safety in this policy and request that it remain at the forefront of all conversations about automated vehicles.

Comment: The steps in this policy to make vehicle manufacturers properly accountable for the design and implementation of the automated features of their products are an improvement on the current free-for-all. But they do not go far enough. Several critical system-level technical requirements are not adequately covered.
In my attached comments I discuss the need for NHTSA to mandate specific performance standards for operation in fault-free state and in cases where systems have reconfigured to deal with fault conditions.
I also raise four other issues: psychological perceptions of safety; need for unified approach to solutions for the Trolley Problem; need for guidance on vehicle condition with respect to its effect on system performance, and need for coordinated policies to resolve unstructured or deadlock scenarios. All of these issues require NHTSA to provide further guidance.

Executive Summary
The attached comments are made on Federal Automated Vehicles Policy for highly automated vehicles (HAVs). Comments are provided on specific suggestions and then general comments to the overall policy. The focus of my comments is from a Validation, V&V, and test practice viewpoint, which includes: systems, hardware, and software considerations. Suggestions are made for the national level but have application to international areas, since the HAV market will eventually be global in nature. Information on reference materials and follow up recommendations are included at the end of the paper.

Some 30 specific and general comments and suggests are made in the file.

Comment: Abstract

The attached note identifies five significant defects in the Vehicle Performance Guidance of the recent HAV policy and suggests changes.

Defect 1. The policy's vague description of a framework for developing and verifying complex, safety-critical software is inadequate.
Defect 2. The policy leaves each Automobile Manufacturer and NHTSA to develop separate problem definitions.
Defect 3. The "Safety Assessment letter" is dangerously incomplete.
Defect 4. Self-certification of complex, safety-critical software by developers inexperienced with such software is dangerous.
Defect 5. Vague terminology is dangerous.

Comment: I encourage NHTSA to include manufacturer testing and reporting requirements for the expected lifespan of parts in any HAV. I have seen a tremendous amount of thought put towards the safe introduction of HAVs, but frighteningly little consideration for these systems as they age. Will LIDAR and Sonar and camera systems and all sensors work just as well at 50k,100k, or 150k miles? What danger is imposed on the driving public when electronic systems begin to fail on their own, or fail to communicate properly with the mechanical systems they operate?

Additionally I encourage the Agency to include guidelines for vehicle maintenance for HAVs. Many of these proposals seem to assume "perfect world" driving scenarios. Bad weather, damaged roads, accident history, and of course poor maintenance all account for imperfect vehicles. How will an improperly maintained HAV protect its occupants and those in other vehicles around it? Will the cars not run at all until certain required maintenance and inspections are completed? What will those inspections consist of and who is responsible for them, in that case? Or perhaps they will be allowed to run and drive in badly maintained states, which could easily increase traffic incidents and fatalities due to negligence of the vehicle owner or fleet owners.

Comment: I am writing you to you regarding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's request for comments on the agency's plan for a federal automated vehicle policy [Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090] noticed on Sept. 20.

According to the NHTSA notice, "Technologies that can help drivers avoid crashes, or help vehicles themselves avoid crashes, are ushering in a new era of safety for the motoring public." These technologies require "sophisticated computer systems and software to interpret and use the data obtained by the vehicle ... to address and mitigate that overwhelming majority of crashes due to human choices or behavior."

Reducing traffic crashes involving motorcycles and decreasing the number of motorcycle operators and passengers injured or killed each year should be a top priority.

With the proliferation of advanced technologies in passenger vehicles and light trucks, I need assurances that the federal automated vehicle policy includes motorcycles as part of its plan.

As outlined in the U.S. Department of Transportation's Fact Sheet: AV Policy Section I: Vehicle Performance Guidance For Automated Vehicles, the plan includes a "15-Point Safety Assessment" to "set clear expectations for manufacturers developing and deploying automated vehicle technologies."
To ensure "clear expectations" are developed at an early stage, the NHTSA needs to test algorithms and software in vehicles to ensure that this new technology adequately and appropriately identifies and properly responds to motorcycles in all traffic situations.

Additionally, I am concerned that vehicle operators will become increasingly dependent on these devices and complacent with regard to their proficiency in operating their vehicle, subscribing to the mindset that "technology will rescue me from any bad decisions I make."

Therefore, the federal automated vehicle policy should include a consumer awareness campaign to educate the public on these new technologies.

Advanced crash-avoidance warning systems technologies used in motor vehicles must not supplant an operator's responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe and responsible manner. While technology can, and should, enhance the actions of the operator to maintain control of the vehicle, safe operation of a motor vehicle should remain the operator's highest priority.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on this important issue.

Comment: I am writing you to you regarding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's request for comments on the agency's plan for a federal automated vehicle policy [Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090] noticed on Sept. 20.

According to the NHTSA notice, "Technologies that can help drivers avoid crashes, or help vehicles themselves avoid crashes, are ushering in a new era of safety for the motoring public." These technologies require "sophisticated computer systems and software to interpret and use the data obtained by the vehicle ... to address and mitigate that overwhelming majority of crashes due to human choices or behavior."

Reducing traffic crashes involving motorcycles and decreasing the number of motorcycle operators and passengers injured or killed each year should be a top priority.

The U.S. Department of Transportation's Fact Sheet: AV Policy Section I: Vehicle Performance Guidance For Automated Vehicles, includes "Application" (applicable motor vehicles) and a "15-Point Safety Assessment" to "set clear expectations for manufacturers developing and deploying automated vehicle technologies."

My Comments:
1) The "Applications" section should specifically include motorcycles for highway operation.
2) The "15 Point Safety Assessment" should state an objective of ensuring HAV technologies, and the vehicle operators, will benefit the safety of operators and passengers of motor vehicles [including motorcycles] lacking HAV technologies of their own.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on this important issue.

Comment: I believe the 'ushering in' of electonic devices for detection and preventure is a hugh mistake. The programming for these systems are years away from being completely reliable. Only if the manufacturers and distributors are held financially and criminally liable should the use of these devices be permitted. A much smarter appoach would be to educate drivers to be a more responsive driver.

These technologies require "sophisticated computer systems and software to interpret and use the data obtained by the vehicle ... to address and mitigate that overwhelming majority of crashes due to human choices or behavior."

Reducing traffic crashes involving motorcycles, bicycles and pedestrians and decreasing the number of motorcycle operators and passengers, bicyclists and pedestrians injured or killed each year should be a top priority.

With the proliferation of advanced technologies in passenger vehicles and light trucks, I need assurances that the federal automated vehicle policy includes motorcycles, bicycles and pedestrians as part of its plan.

As outlined in the U.S. Department of Transportation's Fact Sheet: AV Policy Section I: Vehicle Performance Guidance For Automated Vehicles, the plan includes a "15-Point Safety Assessment" to "set clear expectations for manufacturers developing and deploying automated vehicle technologies."
To ensure "clear expectations" are developed at an early stage, the NHTSA needs to test algorithms and software in vehicles to ensure that this new technology adequately and appropriately identifies and properly responds to motorcycles, bicycles and pedestrians in all traffic situations.

Additionally, I am concerned that vehicle operators will become increasingly dependent on these devices and complacent with regard to their proficiency in operating their vehicle, subscribing to the mindset that "technology will rescue me from any bad decisions I make."

Therefore, the federal automated vehicle policy should include a consumer awareness campaign to educate the public on these new technologies.

Advanced crash-avoidance warning systems technologies used in motor vehicles must not supplant an operator's responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe and responsible manner. While technology can, and should, enhance the actions of the operator to maintain control of the vehicle, safe operation of a motor vehicle should remain the operator's highest priority.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on this important issue.

Advanced crash-avoidance warning systems technologies used in motor vehicles must not supplant an operator's responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe and responsible manner. While technology can, and should, enhance the actions of the operator to maintain control of the vehicle, SAFE OPERATION OF A VEHICLE REMAINS THE OPERATOR'S RESPONSIBILITY.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on this important issue.

Comment: We are writing you to you regarding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's request for comments on the agency's plan for a federal automated vehicle policy [Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090] noticed on Sept. 20.

According to the NHTSA notice, "Technologies that can help drivers avoid crashes, or help vehicles themselves avoid crashes, are ushering in a new era of safety for the motoring public." These technologies require "sophisticated computer systems and software to interpret and use the data obtained by the vehicle ... to address and mitigate that overwhelming majority of crashes due to human choices or behavior."

Reducing traffic crashes involving motorcycles and decreasing the number of motorcycle operators and passengers injured or killed each year should be a top priority.

With the proliferation of advanced technologies in passenger vehicles and light trucks, we need assurances that the federal automated vehicle policy includes motorcycles as part of its plan.

As outlined in the U.S. Department of Transportation's Fact Sheet: AV Policy Section I: Vehicle Performance Guidance For Automated Vehicles, the plan includes a "15-Point Safety Assessment" to "set clear expectations for manufacturers developing and deploying automated vehicle technologies."
To ensure "clear expectations" are developed at an early stage, the NHTSA needs to test algorithms and software in vehicles to ensure that this new technology adequately and appropriately identifies and properly responds to motorcycles in all traffic situations.

Additionally, we are concerned that vehicle operators will become increasingly dependent on these devices and complacent with regard to their proficiency in operating their vehicle, subscribing to the mindset that "technology will rescue me from any bad decisions I make."

Therefore, the federal automated vehicle policy should include a consumer awareness campaign to educate the public on these new technologies.

Advanced crash-avoidance warning systems technologies used in motor vehicles must not supplant an operator's responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe and responsible manner. While technology can, and should, enhance the actions of the operator to maintain control of the vehicle, safe operation of a motor vehicle should remain the operator's highest priority.

Comment: Regarding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090:

According to the NHTSA notice, "Technologies that can help drivers avoid crashes, or help vehicles themselves avoid crashes, are ushering in a new era of safety for the motoring public." These technologies require "sophisticated computer systems and software to interpret and use the data obtained by the vehicle ... to address and mitigate that overwhelming majority of crashes due to human choices or behavior."

What will actually happen is a massive reduction in driver skill as "technology" becomes overly relied-upon. Eventually, a human being driving their own vehicle will be considered reckless, and uninsurable.

We've already seen how Government first promotes dependence, then uses that dependence directly or indirectly against We The People.

This is another step towards technology-based slavery, where people aren't trusted to make the decisions that affect them, and the government uses the data from the technology devices to accomplish warrantless surveilance of the population. "Safety" is NOT more important than "Freedom". Free people can choose to be safe, people made "safe" by government edict can never choose to be free.

Automated/driverless vehicles must be immediately removed from service. Under no circumstances should they be allowed on public roadways. No further research to be permitted. Money to be provided for the promotion of DRIVER SKILL TRAINING.

With the proliferation of advanced technologies in passenger vehicles and light trucks, I need assurances that the federal automated vehicle policy includes motorcycles as part of its plan. Along with this I think you should consider implementing a Federal "No Lane Splitting Rule" to help ensure safety for motorcyclists.

As outlined in the U.S. Department of Transportation's Fact Sheet: AV Policy Section I: Vehicle Performance Guidance For Automated Vehicles, the plan includes a "15-Point Safety Assessment" to "set clear expectations for manufacturers developing and deploying automated vehicle technologies."
To ensure "clear expectations" are developed at an early stage, the NHTSA needs to test algorithms and software in vehicles to ensure that this new technology adequately and appropriately identifies and properly responds to motorcycles in all traffic situations.

Comment: I am writing you to you regarding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's request for comments on the agency's plan for a federal automated vehicle policy [Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090] noticed on Sept. 20.

According to the NHTSA notice, "Technologies that can help drivers avoid crashes, or help vehicles themselves avoid crashes, are ushering in a new era of safety for the motoring public." These technologies require "sophisticated computer systems aynd software to interpret and use the data obtained by the vehicle ... to address and mitigate that overwhelming majority of crashes due to human choices or behavior."

Reducing traffic crashes involving motorcycles and decreasing the number of motorcycle operators and passengers injured or killed each year should be a top priority.

With the proliferation of advanced technologies in passenger vehicles and light trucks, I need assurances that the federal automated vehicle policy includes motorcycles as part of its plan.

As outlined in the U.S. Department of Transportation's Fact Sheet: AV Policy Section I: Vehicle Performance Guidance For Automated Vehicles, the plan includes a "15-Point Safety Assessment" to "set clear expectations for manufacturers developing and deploying automated vehicle technologies."
To ensure "clear expectations" are developed at an early stage, the NHTSA needs to test algorithms and software in vehicles to ensure that this new technology adequately and appropriately identifies and properly responds to motorcycles in all traffic situations.

Additionally, I am concerned that vehicle operators will become increasingly dependent on these devices and complacent with regard to their proficiency in operating their vehicle, subscribing to the mindset that "technology will rescue me from any bad decisions I make."

Therefore, the federal automated vehicle policy should include a consumer awareness campaign to educate the public on these new technologies.

Advanced crash-avoidance warning systems technologies used in motor vehicles must not supplant an operator's responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe and responsible manner. While technology can, and should, enhance the actions of the operator to maintain control of the vehicle, safe operation of a motor vehicle should remain the operator's highest priority.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on this important issue.

Additionally, there should be mandated penalties with significant consequences to manufacturers for any accidents caused by failures of automated equipment when such failures can be shown to have contributed significantly to the accident. These penalties and consequences should increase dramatically should it be shown that such failures are a consequence of defective design or manufacture, or insufficient or fraudulent testing of the automated systems. (e.g. the current situations individually surrounding Tocotta and Volkswagen.)

Additionally, I am concerned that vehicle operators will become increasingly dependent on these devices and complacent with regard to their proficiency in operating their vehicle, subscribing to the mindset that "technology will rescue me from any bad decisions I make." It is important to understand that while motorcyclists operate vehicles that exercise and demand one's concentration, it is important to consider the long-term effects on operators of vehicles that already accommodate too many distractions and lull their drivers with a false sense of security.

Therefore, the federal automated vehicle policy should include a consumer awareness campaign to educate the public on these new technologies and/or funding to design more "motorcycle-only" commuter lanes that provide more protection from those so-called "drivers'" mental skills that will inevitably deteriorate, from "distracted" to "clinically brain-dead", as a result of their growing dependence on, and subjugation to, these technologies.

Advanced crash-avoidance warning systems technologies used in motor vehicles must not supplant an operator's responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe and responsible manner. While technology can, and should, enhance the actions of the operator to maintain control of the vehicle, safe operation of a motor vehicle should remain the operator's highest priority.

I also want to make one additional comment, having the vehicles' performance more closely monitored AND controlled by software opens up a potential for another problem, that of a vehicle's control system being hacked and controlled remotely by someone with possibly criminal intentions. A serious effort must be included to protect and secure the onboard control systems from outside interference.

Comment: I am writing you to you regarding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's request for comments on the agency's plan for a federal automated vehicle policy [Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090] noticed on Sept. 20.

---------- as a motorcyclist, i can scarcely wait for self-driving cars to supplant the stuporous dodos who are presently driving on the roads ! please speed up your processes to get this to happen . . .

According to the NHTSA notice, "Technologies that can help drivers avoid crashes, or help vehicles themselves avoid crashes, are ushering in a new era of safety for the motoring public."

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on this important issue.

Comment: I am writing you to you regarding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's request for comments on the agency's plan for a federal automated vehicle policy [Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090] noticed on Sept. 20.

According to the NHTSA notice, "Technologies that can help drivers avoid crashes, or help vehicles themselves avoid crashes, are ushering in a new era of safety for the motoring public." These technologies require "sophisticated computer systems and software to interpret and use the data obtained by the vehicle ... to address and mitigate that overwhelming majority of crashes due to human choices or behavior."

Reducing traffic crashes involving motorcycles and decreasing the number of motorcycle operators and passengers injured or killed each year should be a top priority. To say nothing of crashes with animals, pedestrians, bicycles, and other objects in the roadway. What about legal liabilities? Insurance?

With the proliferation of advanced technologies in passenger vehicles and light trucks, I need assurances that the federal automated vehicle policy includes motorcycles as part of its plan.

As outlined in the U.S. Department of Transportation's Fact Sheet: AV Policy Section I: Vehicle Performance Guidance For Automated Vehicles, the plan includes a "15-Point Safety Assessment" to "set clear expectations for manufacturers developing and deploying automated vehicle technologies."
To ensure "clear expectations" are developed at an early stage, the NHTSA needs to test algorithms and software in vehicles to ensure that this new technology adequately and appropriately identifies and properly responds to motorcycles in all traffic situations.

Additionally, I am concerned that vehicle operators will become increasingly dependent on these devices and complacent with regard to their proficiency in operating their vehicle, subscribing to the mindset that "technology will rescue me from any bad decisions I make."

Therefore, the federal automated vehicle policy should include a consumer awareness campaign to educate the public on these new technologies.

Advanced crash-avoidance warning systems technologies used in motor vehicles must not supplant an operator's responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe and responsible manner. While technology can, and should, enhance the actions of the operator to maintain control of the vehicle, safe operation of a motor vehicle should remain the operator's highest priority.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on this important issue.

Therefore, the federal automated vehicle policy should include a consumer awareness campaign to educate the public on these new technologies; AND SHOULD REQUIRE the operator to be a participant in the operation of the vehicle either through a physical connection or actual connection and check in every few seconds!

Advanced crash-avoidance warning systems technologies used in motor vehicles must not supplant an operator's responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe and responsible manner. While technology can, and should, enhance the actions of the operator to maintain control of the vehicle, safe operation of a motor vehicle should remain the operator's highest priority.

Comment: I am writing you to you regarding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's request for comments on the agency's plan for a federal automated vehicle policy [Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090] noticed on Sept. 20.

I have carefully read what the American Motorcycle Association has scripted and I agree with it wholeheartedly, however I would like to also add my own words (bracketed) here. The AMA script appears below that.

[I am sincerely afraid that an effort will be made to normalize all motor vehicles to conform to a specific formula in order to apply this new technology uniformly. Just the thought of automatic braking or steering on a motorcycle is alarming to me. Please respect the fact that we citizens who ride motorcycles in the US do so for reasons that may not be fathomable to the general public. Please do not take our motorcycles away, or curtail their use because they cannot conform to a common technology solution.]

According to the NHTSA notice, "Technologies that can help drivers avoid crashes, or help vehicles themselves avoid crashes, are ushering in a new era of safety for the motoring public." These technologies require "sophisticated computer systems and software to interpret and use the data obtained by the vehicle ... to address and mitigate that overwhelming majority of crashes due to human choices or behavior."

Self aware vehicles seem to be a given for our future.
Our legislators need to make sure that these "aware" vehicles are aware of smaller vehicles, such as motorcycles, and of smaller objects in the road; such as pedestrians and children who wander into the road.
After all, the best accident avoidance system is operator awareness.

Comment: I am writing you to you regarding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's request for comments on the agency's plan for a federal automated vehicle policy [Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090] noticed on Sept. 20.

According to the NHTSA notice, "Technologies that can help drivers avoid crashes, or help vehicles themselves avoid crashes, are ushering in a new era of safety for the motoring public." These technologies require "sophisticated computer systems and software to interpret and use the data obtained by the vehicle ... to address and mitigate that overwhelming majority of crashes due to human choices or behavior."

With the proliferation of advanced technologies in passenger vehicles and light trucks, I need assurances that the federal automated vehicle policy includes motorcycles and ALL other smaller vehicles and objects that may be encountered on the roadway as part of its plan.

As outlined in the U.S. Department of Transportation's Fact Sheet: AV Policy Section I: Vehicle Performance Guidance For Automated Vehicles, the plan includes a "15-Point Safety Assessment" to "set clear expectations for manufacturers developing and deploying automated vehicle technologies."
To ensure "clear expectations" are developed at an early stage, the NHTSA needs to test algorithms and software in vehicles to ensure that this new technology adequately and appropriately identifies and properly responds to motorcycles and ALL smaller objects (e.g. small child, etc.) in all traffic situations. Properly responds means that the vehicle self-adjusts its speed, as required, to be able to stop within the distance from its current position to that of the detected object.

Additionally, I am concerned that vehicle operators will become increasingly dependent on these devices and complacent with regard to their proficiency in operating their vehicle, subscribing to the mindset that "technology will rescue me from any bad decisions I make."

Therefore, the federal automated vehicle policy should include a consumer awareness campaign to educate the public on these new technologies.

Advanced crash-avoidance warning systems technologies used in motor vehicles must not supplant an operator's responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe and responsible manner. While technology can, and should, enhance the actions of the operator to maintain control of the vehicle, safe operation of a motor vehicle should remain the operator's highest priority AND responsibility.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on this important issue.

These technologies require "sophisticated computer systems and software to interpret and use the data obtained by the vehicle ... to address and mitigate that overwhelming majority of crashes due to human choices or behavior."

Reducing traffic crashes involving motorcycles and decreasing the number of motorcycle operators and passengers injured or killed each year should be a top priority.

With the proliferation of advanced technologies in passenger vehicles and light trucks, I need assurances that the federal automated vehicle policy includes motorcycles as part of its plan.

As outlined in the U.S. Department of Transportation's Fact Sheet: AV Policy Section I: Vehicle Performance Guidance For Automated Vehicles, the plan includes a "15-Point Safety Assessment" to "set clear expectations for manufacturers developing and deploying automated vehicle technologies."

While technology can, and should, enhance the actions of the operator to maintain control of the vehicle, safe operation of a motor vehicle should remain the operator's highest priority.

In addition, I believe "If modern day cars are computers on wheels, we need mandatory standards, not voluntary guidance, to ensure that our vehicles cannot be hacked and lives and information put in danger."

Comment: I reviewed the The Federal Automated Vehicles Policy, and while I realize the NHTSA inherently has a safety focus, I am struck by the total lack of consideration of transportation system wide design of automated vehicle policy. Automated vehicles will change the world and a lack of system wide analysis in policy formulation will reduce the effectiveness of any policy. Safety cannot be evaluated without an evaluation of the impact of automated vehicles on fuel efficiencies and travel patterns. Automated vehicles will sharply change those patterns and, depending on policy development and implementation, can positively or negatively impact fuel efficiency, congestion and safety on a system wide level.

On the highest system level, fuel efficiencies are directly related to consumer safety since reduced fuel consumption will reduce global warming effects with its associated larger population health issues. As such, while safety policies are vital, they should not be evaluated until a transportation system wide analysis of automated vehicles has been performed. Such analyses may provide entirely different safety or overall regulatory approaches than proscribed in the subject policy.

This issue is further discussed in the attached paper: "Containerization V2.0: The adoption of a five foot standard width for short distance cargo and passenger transportation." (I will be presenting the paper at the SNAME SMC in Seattle on November 4 and a .pdf of the powerpoint is also attached)

Most striking in the analysis performed in the paper, is the possibility that road transportation energy consumptions and congestion will increase if no systematic automated vehicle regulations beyond just safety regulations are adopted.

On the other hand, a simple regulatory limit like a standardized width restriction for automated vehicles will result in very significant efficiency increases, thereby reducing congestion and fuel consumption with their own inherent public benefits.

Thank you for enabling me to comment on this issue, and I remain available for further clarification if needed.

Comment: I am writing you to you regarding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's request for comments on the agency's plan for a federal automated vehicle policy [Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090] noticed on Sept. 20.

According to the NHTSA notice, "Technologies that can help drivers avoid crashes, or help vehicles themselves avoid crashes, are ushering in a new era of safety for the motoring public." These technologies require "sophisticated computer systems and software to interpret and use the data obtained by the vehicle ... to address and mitigate that overwhelming majority of crashes due to human choices or behavior."

Reducing traffic crashes involving motorcycles and decreasing the number of motorcycle operators and passengers injured or killed each year should be a top priority.

With the proliferation of advanced technologies in passenger vehicles and light trucks, I need assurances that the federal automated vehicle policy includes motorcycles as part of its plan.

As outlined in the U.S. Department of Transportation's Fact Sheet: AV Policy Section I: Vehicle Performance Guidance For Automated Vehicles, the plan includes a "15-Point Safety Assessment" to "set clear expectations for manufacturers developing and deploying automated vehicle technologies."
To ensure "clear expectations" are developed at an early stage, the NHTSA needs to test algorithms and software in vehicles to ensure that this new technology adequately and appropriately identifies and properly responds to motorcycles in all traffic situations.

Additionally, I am concerned that vehicle operators will become increasingly dependent on these devices and complacent with regard to their proficiency in operating their vehicle, subscribing to the mindset that "technology will rescue me from any bad decisions I make."

Therefore, the federal automated vehicle policy should include a consumer awareness campaign to educate the public on these new technologies.

Advanced crash-avoidance warning systems technologies used in motor vehicles must not supplant an operator's responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe and responsible manner. While technology can, and should, enhance the actions of the operator to maintain control of the vehicle, safe operation of a motor vehicle should remain the operator's highest priority.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on this important issue.

PS: Friends recently set off a car alarm inadvertently as they walked down the street while trying to set up an unrelated app on their handheld device. Indicates to me how vulnerable systems are to intentionally hacks.

Comment: I am writing you to you regarding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's request for comments on the agency's plan for a federal automated vehicle policy [Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090] noticed on Sept. 20.

According to the NHTSA notice, "Technologies that can help drivers avoid crashes, or help vehicles themselves avoid crashes, are ushering in a new era of safety for the motoring public." These technologies require "sophisticated computer systems and software to interpret and use the data obtained by the vehicle ... to address and mitigate that overwhelming majority of crashes due to human choices or behavior."

Reducing traffic crashes and decreasing the number of people injured or killed each year should be a top priority.

These systems also need to be highly secure and resistant to cracking or other interference by persons with ill intent.

In order to ensure that security is maintained, I urge that all software involved in these systems be required to be Open Source so that any flaws can be rapidly discovered and corrected.

With the proliferation of advanced technologies in passenger vehicles and light trucks, I need assurances that the federal automated vehicle policy includes motorcycles as part of its plan.

As outlined in the U.S. Department of Transportation's Fact Sheet: AV Policy Section I: Vehicle Performance Guidance For Automated Vehicles, the plan includes a "15-Point Safety Assessment" to "set clear expectations for manufacturers developing and deploying automated vehicle technologies."

To ensure "clear expectations" are developed at an early stage, the NHTSA needs to test algorithms and software in vehicles to ensure that this new technology adequately and appropriately identifies and properly responds to motorcycles in all traffic situations.

Additionally, I am concerned that vehicle operators will become increasingly dependent on these devices and complacent with regard to their proficiency in operating their vehicle, subscribing to the mindset that "technology will rescue me from any bad decisions I make."

Therefore, the federal automated vehicle policy should include a consumer awareness campaign to educate the public on these new technologies.

Advanced crash-avoidance warning systems technologies used in motor vehicles must not supplant an operator's responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe and responsible manner. While technology can, and should, enhance the actions of the operator to maintain control of the vehicle, safe operation of a motor vehicle should remain the operator's highest priority.

2.Requiring transparent independence in safety assessment
3.Triggering safety reassessment based on safety integrity, rather than "significant" functionality
4.Requiring assessment of changes that can compromise the triggering of fall-back strategies
5.Characterizing what "reasonable" might mean regarding anticipation of exceptional scenarios
6.Assuring the integrity of data that is likely to be used for crash investigations
7.Diagnostics that encompass non-collision failures of components and end-of-life reliability loss
8.More uniform codification of traffic rule exceptions
9.Ensuring the safety of driver-takeover strategies for SAE Level 2 systems

So once they get all this software going, and vehicles on the road, etc. I suppose what will happen is that people will think they can smoke pot, drink beer and liquor, have sex, text, be on their computers, and play with their children and pets. Then when they kill some one they can just blame the software

I also ask who is to be held legally responsible when a vehicle so equipped runs over a pedestrian, bicyclist, motorcycle or is involved in any other "accident?" The occupant will claim I didn't do it and the manufacturer will claim the occupant didn't do their job as part of agreeing to use said self-driving vehicle. Where does that leave the victim of the accident?

We're living in a world where people take less and less responsibility for their own actions. Self-driving vehicles just codifies that behavior. If anything goes wrong with the technology - and it will - an inexperienced human driver won't be able to do anything about it. The results of such accidents will include the loss of life. Not good.

Comment: I am unclear as to the "real" purpose of a "public" meeting in DC announced 3 days prior to the meeting date.
Perhaps "NHTSA is seeking input to refine the overall structure and content of the safety assessment letter
from the parties responsible for the preparation and submission of these letters" indicates the purpose.
Were these folks notified of the meeting before the general public?
If not, attendees will be those from the "DC crowd" who are not busy next Friday.

Comment: Re Docket ID: NHTSA-2016-0090Agency: NHTSA:DOT

To whom it may concern:

I write in response to the NHTSA's request for comments on the agency's plan for a federal automated vehicle policy [Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090] noticed on Sept. 20.

My concerns are:

1) The argument for the safety benefits expected from highly automated vehicles (HAVs) is not supported by the NHTSA's own research.
2) The agency has not been given the tools and resources to effectively manage the arrival of these vehicles.
3) Because the push towards HAVs has been corporate/capital market rather than government-led, best practices in terms of software transparency and integration are being traded away in favor of proprietary systems that are less safe.

HAVs and Safety
NHTSA's own crash research shows that the conventional wisdom that "blames the driver" is misleading. For example, "Although the critical reason is an important part of the description of events leading up to the crash, it is not intended to be interpreted as the cause of the crash nor as the assignment of the fault to the driver, vehicle, or environment." Singh, S. (2015, February). Critical reasons for crashes investigated in the National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey. (Traffic Safety Facts CrashStats. Report No. DOT HS 812 115). The question remains: why are drivers, fully licensed by the state as competent, put in situations in which they can make fatal errors?

Furthermore, studies by the RAND corporation have concluded that HAVs "would have to be driven hundreds of millions of miles and sometimes hundreds of billions of miles to demonstrate their reliability in terms of fatalities and injuries." (Driving to Safety, http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1478.html , accessed Nov. 8, 2016) The authors of this particular study suggest that a test fleet of 100 cars driving 24 hours a day would have to drive for 400 to 500 years to draw any conclusions.

Proven strategies, such as traffic calming and passive pedestrian protection, exist. Government should spend its time focusing on a Vision Zero that works.

Tools and Resources
Neither the Department of Transportation, state agencies, or local governments have been given the resources to develop and deploy the kinds of Vehicle-to-Vehicle and Vehicle-to-infrastructure systems necessary to realize the full benefits of these new machines. As planned in 1991, and executed as a demonstration project in 1997, an integrated, government-led system of technological infrastructure was on the path to success. Unfortunately, the corporate interests involved - insurance companies, auto companies - spent most of their time worrying about costs and especially torts. So, the money for research and development eventually dried up.

Corporate Leads the Way
Today, corporations pushing HAVs are so much better capitalized then the agencies supposed to support them that the system will not be optimal. Put simply, if the government cannot afford to paint the lines on the road, HAVs will have trouble staying in their lanes. Also, corporations have fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders and need the support of capital markets. They are therefore opting for proprietary software. Distributed, open-source software has proven to be more transparent and robust. The government built ARPANET and later the Internet. DARPA funded major research into autonomy.

The American people built the Interstate Highway System because they believed it would improve commerce and safety. It would lead to a better life. That spirit should guide the federal government's stance on HAVs, V2V, and V2I development.

About me
I have been studying and writing about roads, cars, and auto safety for more than 30 years. My work has appeared online, in the popular press, and academic journals. Here are two relevant citations:
Silent Victories, The history and practice of public health in twentieth-century America (Oxford University Press, 2007, Ward and Warren, editors); Are we there yet? Cars, robots, and the end of driving in America (WW Norton, forthcoming). I hold a Ph.D. in History from the University of Michigan.

Public Comments

Referenced Design Levels Standard SAE J3016
Proposed DOT Testing Levels (Addition)

NHTSA expects manufacturers and entities to classify their HAV system(s) as described in the Society of Automotive Engineers SAE J3016 Standard for Design Levels of Automation.

At SAE Level 0, the human driver does everything.

At SAE Level 1, an automated system on the vehicle can sometimes assist the human driver to conduct some parts of the driving task.

At SAE Level 2, an automated system on the vehicle can actually conduct some parts of the driving task, while the human continues to monitor the driving environment and performs the rest of the driving task.

At SAE Level 3, an automated system can both actually conduct some parts of the driving task and monitor the driving environment in some instances, but the human driver must be ready to take back control when the automated system requests.

At SAE Level 4, an automated system can conduct the driving task and monitor the driving environment, and the human need not take back control, but the automated system can operate only in certain environments and under certain conditions.

At SAE Level 5, the automated system can perform all driving tasks, under all conditions that a human driver could perform them.

Department of Transportation
(Proposed Amendment to Add for DOT Testing Levels)

At DOT Level 0, the automobile and light duty truck is tested for structural absorption and or diversion for compartment integrity and personnel restraints and or movement absorption for all seat locations.

At DOT Level 1, the automobile and light duty truck is tested for warning systems, audio beeps and buzzers and or tactile vibrations or buzzers and or visual and or lighted alerts.

At DOT Level 2, the automobile and light duty truck is tested for assist systems, tactile resistance and or initial intervention of directional and or speed with human driver counter measures.

At DOT Level 3, the automobile and light duty truck is tested for automatic systems, complete intervention and or activation of autonomous directional and or speed control from human driver.

At DOT Level 4, the automobile and light duty truck is tested for autonomous systems, directional and or speed control with no human driver interface and or intervention.

Comments:
I must begin by stating that I am pleasantly surprised at the level of detail in the Federal Automated Vehicle Policy released to the public in late September, it was worth the wait.

I especially appreciate the 15 point assessment for the development of automated vehicles and the reference to the SAE Standard J3016 containing the levels of design.

The reason for my proposed amendment comes from an engineering safety designer. These responsibilities include specifying testing procedures.

The SAE levels of design must overlap as they progress from some autonomous involvement through levels of driver involvement to no driver requirements in the fully automatic level.

These overlaps of automation are a nightmare when trying to define how to test each of these engineering levels. The conditions for each test and the required results will be very lengthy and very hard to keep clearly on target.

Other than simplifying the SAE Design Levels that need to be expansive in order to allow for a full range of designs, these DOT Testing Levels are much less conditional.

This DOT Level 2, Assist and Level 3, Automatic Testing Definitions are clearly divided and to the point. These DOT Testing Levels are very clear and can be simulated under laboratory conditions without risk to the testing technicians.

Further I would estimate the DOT-L3 Test of a SAE-L3 Automatic Pilot is not that far off for under 45mph for day clear-weather on divided-roads. However it will be considerable progress in ten years if the infrastructure is in place for the automotive manufacture to get over 60mph in the DOT-L3 Test of a SAE-L4 Automatic Pilot especially for day/night moderate-weather on divided-roads.

"Ethical Considerations for Highly Automated Vehicles in America"
By: Jesse Ross
October 15th, 2016

Preface

The NHTSA has asked for public comment regarding its Policies and Regulations of HAVs (Highly Automated Vehicles). The attached document primarily addresses Section I - 11: Ethical Considerations of the NHTSA's recently published "Federal Automated Vehicles Policy - Accelerating the Next Revolution in Roadway Safety" document that was published in September of 2016. The following insights are presented in an easily accessible format that I feel enables readers to comprehend complex topics rapidly. I do hope that this document will be suitable for citation and reference in other research and I grant the NHTSA, the DOT, and any other interested party my full permission to use this document or portions of it to that effect so long as credit is given where due.

Regards,

Jesse Ross

Comment: e docket being developed I must say I would NEVER get into a car which I did not have complete control over as a driver. Having a computer driven car is a ridiculous idea which does not encourage human beings to be alert but rather continues the 'dumbing down' of the human race. I would NEVER trust a computer or machine's ability over my own. This can be hacked as any other computer can be. Perhaps this IS the desired result. Thumbs down, BAD idea!

Comment: dlhBOWLES, a domestic manufacturer of engineered plastic and fluid management products and a Tier 1 supplier of automotive components with offices in Canton, Ohio and Columbia, Maryland, submits the following comments in response to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) Federal Automated Vehicles Policy announced on September 20, 2016. For several decades dlhBOWLES has supplied and continues to supply windshield washer products enabling manufacturers of motor vehicles to comply with 49 CFR 571.104, ensuring that the driver of a vehicle always has an unobstructed view through the windshield to enable safe operation of the vehicle under adverse conditions. dlhBOWLES agrees with NHTSA that highly automated vehicles (HAVs) have great potential to reduce roadway fatalities, but believes the currently proposed Federal Automated Vehicles Policy language falls short in ensuring this goal, in that there is no analogous system mandated to ensure a minimum level of functionality of a HAV's sensors in the event of adverse conditions.

Comment: 1. Travel lane mandate for HAV is a must.
2. Future roles of Flying Cars and Drones must be included in the future
rulemaking
3. Mirrorless Cars as SAE Level 2 Cars:
data recording and sharing cannot be exclusively dealt by HAV,
but can also be effectively handled by non-HAV mirrorless cars of level 2
4. Rulemaking is required to address platform wars anticipated from emerging
fragmentation of self-driving OS (Operating system) technology in terms of
backward compatibility, interoperability and scope of accountability of
potential liability risks.

I do not anticipate the technology will meet its' potential for safety and efficiency in the very beginning. It will take time.

Comment: I appreciate NHTSA's forward-thinking approach to this issue. As an employee in the auto insurance industry, the prospect of autonomous vehicles threatens my livelihood (when vehicles no longer crash, personal auto insurance will become markedly cheaper). Even still, the lives of my family, friends, and strangers are far more important. I conduct a significant amount of research on autonomous vehicles, and I believe their advent to be crucial to making the roads safer for all.

For government to step in a slow things down for the sake of process would be a grave mistake. Even poorly designed autonomous vehicles will likely save lives compared to the human fallibility, carelessness, negligence, and recklessness we deal with today. So please, do not let the good be the enemy of the perfect.

Work with OEMs to speed this technology through. Serve as a partner and guide rather than a gatekeeper. Our lives literally depend on it.

Comment: o offer a solution to current problems in most keyless ignition vehicles and problems which are anticipated in automated vehicles.
FMVSS 114 states: S5.2.2 Except as specified in S5.2.4, the vehicle must be designed such that the transmission or gear selection control cannot move from the "park" position, unless the key is in the starting system.
The Code of Federal Regulations Title 49 Part 571.114 published Oct 1, 2016 states: under S5.1 Theft protection. S5.1.1 Each vehicle must have a starting system which whenever the key is removed from the starting system prevents: (a) The normal activation of the vehicle's engine or motor; and (b) Either steering, or forward self-mobility, of the vehicle, or both.

A Two Step Start System, which includes identifying the electronic key inside the vehicle, once it is started, in order to shift into a drive gear, solves the problems which occur now because of non-compliance with FMVSS 114. This identification will also be necessary in autonomous cars. A coded electronic key is authenticated twice, first to start the car and second to put the car into gear. The 2nd authentication of the key can be a totally different code and would have a range effective only inside the vehicle. This prevents driving off without the electronic key. It also would deter a thief unless he/she was in possession of the actual key.

For any autonomous vehicle apps which control driverless cars without passengers and for any unforeseen "emergency" situations, an override temporary "Valet" program could be added that would 1) be available only thru encrypted 2FA password protection 2) be of short duration and 3) return the vehicle to the DEFAULT after each use.

Comment: afety Administration's (NHTSA) request for comments on the agency's plan for a federal automated vehicle

In response to the request from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on comments related to the agency's plan on autonomous vehicles, I would like to submit my comments for the record.

Model State Policy Comment

It appears that NHTSA wants the state and local government to just issue driver licenses, car registration, traffic laws and enforcement, and make sure that vehicles have insurance and leave everything else up to the federal government to handle. The big issue with this approach is what happens when the federal government refuses or overlooks a policy/issue. Point of example, currently NHTSA has no policy/regulation on preventing or mitigating the possibility of someone using an autonomous vehicle as a weapon of destruction, which then leaves open a huge security threat for individual states.

So according to the Federal Automated Vehicle Policy, this would prevent state government from implementing their own vehicle security policy, as it would "interfere" with DOT and their partners of American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrator. So who is to blame when the federal government implement policies that blocks state government from protection itself from homeland security threats?

The current Federal Automated Vehicle Policy is pretty much a waste of paper for printing as it is not a "requirement" to implement and is considered as a "guideline" to use. With the automotive and technology companies, only requirement is to file with NHTSA that they have "considered" a safety assessment section. In other word, the industry is establishing the rules of the game once again, without any oversight. Has anyone considered that the high number of deaths on roadways today could have been prevented or reduced many years ago, if NHTSA had actually implemented regulation and not left things up to the automotive companies?

Safety Assessment Letter Comment

Vehicle Cybersecurity - the guideline is a narrow focus on the overall vehicle security issue. While cybersecurity is an important factor for vehicle security, the HAV policy does not go far enough. Letting the industry to follow "best practice" to solve the cybersecurity issue still leaves open the possibility of someone calling up an autonomous taxicab, opening the door, loading up the vehicle with explosives, punching in coordinates, shutting the door, and sending the vehicle to its destination. All allowable under the safety assessment section as NO cybersecurity hacking or manipulation was involved. In other words, the "drone on wheels" vehicle operated as normal under the policy. If the policy is amended to require the industry to incorporate sensors to detect explosives or other hazardous materials, then the vehicle would have been disabled and therefore closing the hole in security.

I have attached a revised Vehicle Security section definition to be considered as a replacement.

Human Machine Interface - The policy is lacking one major issue and that is to provide information in the language of the occupant in the vehicle. With millions of people visiting the United States each year, it is a good chance that someone of foreign nationality will be in an autonomous vehicle (or autonomous taxicab). As such, the vehicle needs to provide warnings or information messages in the language of occupant/driver/rider. Basing the HMI language on speech/voice has some drawbacks and is not always correct or understood. Likewise, basing the HMI language off a user mobile device is another approach for setting the language. NHTSA needs to require the industry to make sure that communication between vehicle and occupant in a language that occupant understand.

Has everyone lost their minds? What good can come from this technology when EVERY computer in the planet can be hacked by some kid in his mom's basement? What are YOU thinking? And you're talking about big-rig trucks, too?

We as a society are NOT ready for "The Jetsons". The technology is NOT ready to put these death machines on our roads!

Your job is "safety"! Put an end to this madness and outlaw "self-driving" cars until they are made safe, the techonolgy is perfected and YOU can promise "no hacks".

For if YOU allow these vehicles on the road and THEY cause an accident, YOU WILL BE CULPABLE by allowing this to happen!

Comment: It is imperative that self driving vehicles be configured to recognize motorcycles. Language should be added to the laws governing self
driving vehicle operating systems to ensure the safety of all others on the road. The designers of the automated driving systems need to
be required to test their systems to ensure that they detect motorcycles.

Comment: First, I am encouraged to see that the NHTSA recognizes the extraordinary potential automated vehicles have to improve the lives of those who cannot currently drive due to medical impairment. As someone with family members who cannot currently drive due to medical conditions, and who is responsible for providing all of their transportation needs, I see every day how the loss of this freedom that so many of us take for granted can have a profound impact, not just from a practical and logistical standpoint, but an emotional and mental one.

I strongly encourage and request that NHTSA and other federal and state agencies working on automated vehicle policy make provisions in the rules to allow people who cannot drive the ability to still operate an automated vehicle. Even better, if fully-autonomous vehicles aren't available, but sufficient capability exists to reliably detect driver incapacitation or an imminent accident and deal appropriately with the situation, I would request that there be provisions allowing such drivers (e.g. those with epilepsy) to at least operate on a license restricting them to such vehicles.

However, as an engineer in the civil aircraft industry, I would strongly caution NHTSA and other agencies about following the FAA's aircraft certification model too closely. While the regulations concerning the aircraft itself (e.g. 14CFR23 and 14CFR25) are largely well thought-out and appropriate (if somewhat overly prescriptive at times), the FAA's model for showing compliance to the regulations and producing certified designs is a nightmare of paperwork, busywork, and formalized micromanagment. Adoption of this model for the production of automated vehicles would guarantee that only a handful of such vehicles would ever be produced, and the designs would never be updated over time.

The quality control and configuration management processes currently in use at major automakers are more than sufficient for producing automated vehicles. The current safety recall system, perhaps with one or two minor changes, is sufficient for dealing with post-purchase modifications and changes that need to be made. The last thing we need to do is require automakers to comply with an equivalent to 14CFR21, the TSO and PMA process, and all of the other non-value-added tracking and paperwork processes inherent to producing certified airplanes.

Comment: I am writing to you regarding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's request for comments on the agency's plan for a federal automated vehicle policy [Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090] noticed on Sept. 20. The League of American Bicyclists (League) appreciates the opportunity to comment on behalf of our more than 30,000 individual members and affiliated bicycle groups.

The overwhelming concern of the League and our members is that automated vehicles contribute to a safer environment for people who walk, bike, and otherwise interact with these vehicles. Reducing traffic crashes involving bicycles and decreasing the number of people on bikes who are injured or killed each year should be a top priority.

Comment: opportunity to submit comments to the Department of Transportation's Federal Automated Vehicles Policy (FAVP).

We are encouraged by this initial framework to the automobile industry for developing safe autonomous vehicles. While we are grateful that steps have been taken to clarify the regulatory roles of the federal and state governments for governing HAVs, we have grave concerns that NHTSA's current regulatory tools. We believe a reformed, agile and data-driven approach can be designed in a manner that leverages 21st century technologies, tools and techniques in order to speed regulatory approval of designs and material changes to vehicle architectures and components. Approvals should take days, not months or years.

That said, we applaud, DOT's approach as a creative departure from its traditional regulatory approach in an effort to be more responsive and better align regulation with innovation cycles.

The FAVP includes the following four sections:

1.Vehicle Performance Guidance

We support this section's details providing general guidance and expectations for assessing the safety of HAVs though a voluntary 15-point Safety Assessment.

While each element is important, ATI21.org believes that data collection and sharing element is critically important. We believe that appropriate testing, operational and simulation data should be collected by every manufacturer of autonomous vehicles, and that a data repository should be established to collect and analyze this critical data from across the industry. We further envision that leadership and staff are independent of any particular manufacturer and that the repository itself be a private, non-profit entity with a board of key stakeholders including government regulators. Participation should be opt-in and sufficient incentives to participate should be established such as rapid approval of design changes or liability indemnification in exchange for providing required data.

2.Model State Policy

We believe the FAVP provides welcome clarification to the appropriate and respective roles of the federal and state governments in governing the safe operation of HAVs.

3.Current Regulatory Tools

The FAVP reaffirms that it will continue to apply its traditional approach and regulatory tools that are rooted in the Highway Safety Act of 1966 to HAVs. As written, the FAVP clearly states that vehicle designs including HAVs must comply with all applicable provisions of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS).

It is important to note that these standards when written, did not contemplate autonomous vehicles. Consequently the FMVSS includes some 286 references to human drivers, mandates traditional design features such as steering wheels, displays and pedals. Level 4 and 5 vehicles by definition would violate more than one-third of those standards and run afoul of half of the Series 100 Crash Avoidance standards.

ATI21.org believes that the autonomous vehicles should be exempt from the FMVSS and simplified guidance be developed that allows for design approval based on submission and sharing of operational and test data. Our organization would be delighted to help the Department develop such guidance.

4.Future Regulatory Tools

The FAVP leaves the door open to consider other approaches that may be more suited to both improving the safe development, testing and deployment of HAVs. These include pre-market approval processes currently used by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In these cases, DOT proposes testing prototypes to determine if safety standards are met before granting production approval.

While the examples provided are somewhat dated, cumbersome and slow, there is a clear opportunity to provide input to inform a new regulatory paradigm that can rely on modern tools and methods such as modeling and simulation, predictive analysis, regression, and artificial intelligence to inform design approval decisions.

We believe the Department should abandon any attempt using the examples they offer and instead commission the design of a new regulatory approval process that leverages the types of technology, tools and techniques described above.

Conclusion

The FAVP, by Washington D.C. standards, represents a bold first step toward accelerating the deployment of autonomous vehicles. We look forward to working with the Department of Transportation on the development of a 21st century regulatory structure that will achieve the objective of accelerating the deployment of self-driving.

Finally, we recognize that DoT is an important piece of this objective and think these efforts must be augmented with leadership from the Executive Office of the President. For that reason we have issued a Strategic Framework to Accelerate Life-Saving, Self-driving Vehicles and are including this document with our comments.

Comment: John Creamer and Dan Malone submit that NHTSA will need new tools and processes to address the challenges and opportunities of automated driving technologies. Automated vehicles represent a fundamental departure from the past century of road transportation. The Federal Automated Vehicles Policy underscores the need for collaboration among federal, state, and local highway authorities, manufacturers, vehicle service providers, safety advocates, drivers, and the public to develop effective responses. Moreover, the US must engage at the international level to promote uniformity and represent US interests. NHTSA will need new mechanisms to lead these efforts. We propose that DOT establish a National Vehicle Safety Forum comprised of stakeholder representatives to assist NHTSA in developing voluntary and mandatory Federal Automotive Safety Technical (FAST) standards in the public interest. The goal is to rapidly build and maintain a common understanding of specific needs at the technical level to support and facilitate innovation and the deployment of life-saving automated technologies.

Re: Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090

On behalf of the Traffic Safety & Security Division of the 3M Company, we are pleased to provide comment on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's request for comments on the agency's plan for a federal automated vehicle policy [Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090] released on September 20, 2016.

These federal guidelines for the safe testing and deployment of autonomous vehicle technologies are an important step in the evolution of new technologies for use on the roadways and we commend the Department of Transportations work in this area.

The 3M Company has a long history of innovation in transportation safety, starting in 1939 with the invention of the first fully reflective traffic sign. To this day, 3M continues to develop and deploy advanced materials technologies to deliver driver guidance and roadway navigation solutions for the next generation of vehicle automation.

In the Model State Policy section of the guidelines, the Department notes that autonomous vehicles will require standardized pavement markings, traffic signals, and signage.

We concur that the success of these transformative vehicle technologies will depend upon the deployment of materials that will simplify the link between existing transportation infrastructure and driver-assistive functionality and autonomous driving.

As the federal guidelines on autonomous vehicles are developed, the 3M Traffic Safety & Security Division looks forward to working with NHTSA and the Department on the deployment of innovative infrastructure technologies that serve the needs of the driving population and maximize roadway mobility and motorist safety.

Comment: A Software Tester's Concerns about the "Federal Automated Vehicles Policy" - A much more comprehensive version of this is at www.edmundmiller.wordpress.com

The Federal Automated Vehicles Policy - A Software Tester's Concerns
As was the Healthcare (or "Obamacare") Website, the adoption and testing of "autonomous vehicles" (I'm tempted to say "Obama Car") is overwhelmingly a "software testing" project. The analogy between the two, and the lack of solid "buck stops here" ownership over this project is very concerning as I view the "Federal Automated Vehicles Policy".

There also seems to be a very important (likely high volume and deadly) mistake in the logic applied by the NHTSA when discussing the safety levels of these cars. There is no reason for the NHTSA to assume that a human driver - even when fully attentive - will be able to react in time to every mistake made by an automated system! One simply needs to imagin. If a driver is concentrating intensely on the road ahead and a passenger suddenly jerks the steering wheel to the side for no reason, it will spark all sorts of reflexes and reactions within the driver's mind as he/she attempts to make sense of what just happened. The brain's response might be "Don't adjust the wheel because there must have been a good reason why my passenger did this". Or it could be the exact opposite reaction, thus creating an over compensation in steering. These episodes will always occur - by definition - as complete surprises. There is absolutely no way for drivers to safely practice, or anticipate these realities ahead of time! It is preposterous for the NHTSA to be validating this "assumption of ultimate responsibility" (over mistakes made by the automated system) by applying it to this project! This "clause" is being used as a "catch all" by all those involved as a way of avoiding a more complex and realistic discussion surrounding true causal factors.

My overall recommendations to the Federal DOT and NHTSA -

#1) The NHTSA should mandate and monitor the use of a single overall "Test Plan" (created and updated within a single software application) that is shared, viewed, accessed, and updated by all of the car manufacturers. This single overall "Test Plan" will list all of the real world scenarios (each one representing a single "test case") that the cars of each particular "automation level" will need to navigate safely. This particular stage of testing - by definition here - must be conducted using a completely assembled car at speed, with all systems activated (individual component testing is a separate issue). These scenarios ("test cases") should be reviewed ahead of time for completeness, shared among all manufacturers, and of course then tested by each manufacturer under their own proprietary system. As new "tricky and dangerous" scenarios are discovered, these new "test cases" must be added to the original test plan (instantly viewable by all - as before). Each manufacturer must assign ownership of the testing of each individual test case to a single tester who will be responsible for literally "signing off" (as in actual "signature"!) when a car passes a particular test. Keep in mind that this particular overall "test plan" only describes the real world scenarios these cars must navigate safely (applicable to all manufacturers) and does not require the recording or revealing of any proprietary information. The potentially proprietary discussions related to the handling of problems (or "bugs") will be controlled separately under each companies' individual "project tracking" system as described below.

#2) Though not established by the NHTSA, each manufacturer should of course have their own "project tracking" system to track problems and their resolutions as they occur. This would of course follow standard software practices (assigning a unique identifier to each issue; stating whose hands a particular issue is in at any given moment in time; cross referencing the applicable test case if relevant; and so on).

#3) As these vehicles "go live" on our roadways (the "beta test"), there must be the establishment of an easy to use method by which the general population (bigtime "stakeholders") can report any and all dangerous encounters. Of course this will lead to duplicate entries as some of the same problems repeat themselves. Therefore, on the same webpage, the NHTSA needs to continually update a "known problems" section which enables a citizen to quickly log a "this happened to me also" entry. This will not only save everyone time and trouble, but it will also add some very important and relevant emphasis to particular dangers.

#4) The NHTSA must eliminate completely the notion that drivers can be held ultimately responsible (under any "level" of automation) for mistakes made by an automated system.

Comment: Ford Motor Company (Ford), a domestic manufacturer and importer of motor vehicles with offices at One American Road, Dearborn, Michigan 48126-2798, submits the following comments in response to the Federal Automated Vehicle Policy (FAVP) for the safe deployment and operation of automated vehicles.

We appreciate NHTSA's leadership and efforts to chart a policy pathway that will help accelerate the development and deployment of automated technology. Ford is serious about bringing automated vehicles to market because of their potential to bring significant benefits to consumers. Our CEO, Mark Fields, announced this summer that Ford intends to bring to market SAE Level 4 (L4) automated vehicles (AV) for geo-fenced ride-hailing or ride-sharing applications in 2021. We share a common goal with NHTSA of ensuring safety while helping to facilitate safety innovation.

Comment: Comments of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Technology Engagement Center

Highly Automated Vehicles ("HAVs") have tremendous potential to make our roads safer, enhance worker productivity, increase transportation efficiency, and deliver numerous other societal benefits that are currently unimaginable. With its deep automobile manufacturing experience and capability along with world-leading information, communications, and technology ("ICT") companies, the United States has the potential to define and lead this new life-saving innovation and business opportunity. NHTSA's recently issued Notice and Request for Comments on the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy (the "Guidance") opens the dialogue on the appropriate national framework that will promote the investment and innovation necessary for U.S. companies to claim a leadership role in this new era of transportation. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Technology Engagement Center ("C_TEC") welcomes the opportunity to provide input to NHTSA on this important topic. The Chamber established C_TEC to be the face of technology in the economy and to advocate for rational policy solutions that drive economic growth, spur innovation, and create jobs through the backing of a leading national and global business organization. C_TEC's comments are attached.

Comment: nomous vehicles" (I'm tempted to say "Obama Car") is overwhelmingly a "software testing" project. The analogy between the two, and the lack of solid "buck stops here" ownership over this project is very concerning as I view the "Federal Automated Vehicles Policy".

The DOT and NHTSA are (kind of) claiming overall ownership of this project, while readily admitting they can only make "Best Practice" suggestions. The size and complexities of this new computer code no doubt dwarf that of the healthcare website.

The existence of different, proprietary systems (not designed to talk with each other) can be pointed to for starters. This new project (also) involves "retrofitting" software (in this case to a massively diverse physical infrastructure that wasn't designed with these vehicles in mind). Control of these roads and laws is fiercely guarded by 50 different state jurisdictions. In fact, the NHTSA and Federal DOT have emphatically quoted these jurisdiction issues to me in the past when explaining why they could not address, or even comment on numerous road safety dangers I brought to their attention! So, has something suddenly and magically changed that now allows these discussions that (I was previously told) are "prohibited by law"? Those interested should read my essays located at www.edmundmiller.wordpress.com (In the case of New Jersey's "Stop and Stay Stopped" crosswalk law subsequent rises in pedestrian deaths - contrary to concurrent drops in all other types of auto deaths during some of these same years - seemed to confirm my fears, but that is a whole other story!)

In actuality, the REAL testing of the safety level of these automated cars will occur when they are introduced onto our public streets. So get ready people - we are actually all the "stakeholders" here!

I fully appreciate the awkward position the Federal DOT and NHTSA have been put into by the President's push to promote this automation. It should be noted that the NHTSA is (kind of) claiming this ownership at the same time it has not been given the resources, expertise, or even the mandate to take proper control. When bad things happen - and they will - automakers will be able to point to the NHTSA's (sort of) claims of ownership over the early phases of this project.

There is also a huge mistake being made in that there is no reason for the NHTSA, or anyone else for that matter, to assume that a human driver - even when fully attentive - will be able to react in time to every mistake made by an automated system! This "clause" is being used as a "catch all" by all those involved as a way of avoiding a more complex and realistic discussion surrounding true causal factors.

At the very least, the following actions should be taken by the NHTSA:

#1) The NHTSA should mandate and monitor the use of a single overall "Test Plan" (created and updated within a single software application) that is shared, viewed, accessed, and updated by all of the car manufacturers. This single overall "Test Plan" will list all of the real world scenarios (each one representing a single "test case") that the cars of each particular "automation level" will need to navigate safely. This particular stage of testing - by definition here - must be conducted using a completely assembled car at speed, with all systems activated (individual component testing is a separate issue). These scenarios ("test cases") should be reviewed ahead of time for completeness, shared among all manufacturers, and of course then tested by each manufacturer under their own proprietary system. Testers must be required to literally "sign off" (as in actual "signature"!) when a car passes a particular test. Keep in mind that this particular overall "test plan" only describes the real world scenarios these cars must navigate safely (applicable to all manufacturers) and does not require the recording or revealing of any proprietary information. The potentially proprietary discussions related to the handling of problems (or "bugs") will be controlled separately under each companies' individual "project tracking" system as described below.

#2) Each manufacturer should of course have their own "project tracking" system to track problems and resolutions as they occur, following standard software practices.

#3) As these vehicles "go live" on our roadways (the "beta test"), there must be the establishment of an easy to use method for the public to report any and all dangerous encounters. To cut down on duplication, the NHTSA needs to continually update a "known problems" section enabling citizens to quickly log a "this happened to me also" entry. This will also add emphasis to common dangers.

#4) The NHTSA must eliminate completely the assertion that drivers are ultimately responsible (under any "level" of automation) for recovering from mistakes made by the automated system.

Comment: I read the Policy with interest, as I am an attorney who has been practicing in the areas of privacy and data security for over 15 years. I have reviewed many of the submitted comments, and will therefore limit my input to a few key areas. I additionally join with comments previously submitted by Stephen Selander of the Selander Law Office, and have welcomed the opportunity to discuss the Policy with Mr. Selander.

1. Privacy: I concur with other commenters that privacy issues seem beyond the legislative mandate of NHTSA. While we still lack general federal privacy legislation, such laws do exist at the federal level in a number of industries (healthcare, financial institutions, consumers) and at the state level. I believe NHTSA should stay focused on vehicle safety, and leave the privacy of owners/users to other enforcement bodies.

2. Safety Assessment Letter: NHTSA would benefit by promptly clarifying the intent behind, and value of, requiring these letters. For example, the introduction states that NHTSA expects both manufacturers and "other entities" will provide these reports. The broad definition of "other entities" could be read to mean that software developers far down the supply chain would be expected to provide a Safety Assessment. If this is not intended, state as such. Separately, is NHTSA considering any kind of "safe harbor" for entities that provide an Assessment that reflects Guidance compliance? What is the intended review/response process? What are the consequences, if any for an entity that opts not to perform an Assessment?

3. Cybersecurity: The integrity and security of vehicle systems data and information is clearly a safety concern. The Wired Magazine Jeep Cherokee hack opened many eyes to this real and present danger, which could be exacerbated through the proliferation of connected vehicle technologies. Other industries have been grappling with these issues for years. Perhaps the best analog exists in the healthcare industry. As with the safe operation of connected vehicles, the integrity and availability of digital information is of paramount concern in the use of electronic health records and mobile health technology. The Department of Health and Human Services, through its HealthIT.gov initiative, has engaged health IT providers in an effort to "cure" interoperability issues among systems using electronic health information. The Interoperability Roadmap, found here: https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/interoperability, recognizes that the "collaborative efforts of stakeholders is crucial to achieving the vision of a learning health system where individuals are at the center of their care; providers have a seamless ability to securely access and use health information from different sources." Driving cooperation among HAV vendors to develop robust cybersecurity standards should be a NHTSA priority - the question is whether it is driven through regulation or through persuasion (the path presently chosen by HHS for interoperability).

The FDA has also weighed in on safety concerns pertaining to mobile health technology. Its guidance on the classification and regulation of software as a medical device and mobile medical apps suggests a framework that might be of use in regulating software-reliant vehicle systems - for example, a higher level of testing required for software that is directly involved in the safe operation of the vehicle. See, http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM263366.pdf; http://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm524904.pdf . The point here is that NHTSA could potentially benefit from outreach to industries with more mature experience with software-based technologies that can pose safety concerns.

Finally, as with safety-related data integrity issues (i.e., interoperability), the healthcare industry via the HIPAA regulations has implemented a robust regulatory framework aimed at securing electronic information. The HIPAA Security Rule requires entities that handle electronic protected health information (ePHI) to adopt appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to guard against the unauthorized breach or disclosure of the ePHI. Lessons learned regarding technical safeguarding under HIPAA might be useful in determining best practices for securing HAV-related software.

I look forward to monitoring NHTSA's further implementation of the Policy.

Comment: Since there is no human occupant present, we request explicit clarification that production non-occupied highly automated (level 4 and greater) low speed vehicles (below 40 kph) do not require compliance with the following nominal requirements listed under FMVSS 571.500 Low Speed Vehicles":

1. seat belts (S5.10)
2. vehicle mirrors (S5.6)
3. windshield visibility and glazing (S5.8)
4. rear visibility (S5.11)
5. manual parking brake (S5.7)

The rationale for requesting non-compliance is as follows, with numbers corresponding to the list above:

1. There is no human occupant that needs to be restrained in the event of a crash.
2. The autonomy computer will perform perception functions using external sensors.
3. The autonomy computer will perform perception functions using external sensors.
4. There is no human occupant to view the rear view image being displayed.
5. The vehicle will park automatically using wheel brakes, transmission brakes, or a parking pawl when appropriate per vehicle state.

Comment: Just as digital music has replaced the cd, which replaced the cassette tape, which replaced the 8-track that replaced the record, technology is at the forefront of all Americans lives. This may be a hard pill to swallow, as many people doubt technology. The technological advancements that I have personally seen over the past 25 or so years has scared me to death, at the same time improved life for so many on virtually every possible level of existence. As much as some may believe that technology fails and autonomous vehicles aren't going to be as safe as we all want during the first decade or so, while bugs and other deficiencies are worked out, but this new wave of the future is already here and it can't be stopped. Furthermore, there are so many traffic fatalities on a daily basis in the world that I strongly believe that as more and more people upgrade to these autonomous vehicles, traffic accidents and fatalities will gradually diminish. This may also put some industries in less urban environments out of business, especially taxi services. Even the very drunk or even those in need of emergency medical attention will no longer need to find a ride or call an ambulance. The autonomous vehicle, it manufactured how I envision, will be able to take passengers safely to any destination by gps, and sensory technology. No more dui's or waiting on an ambulance when minutes matter. With technology, these vehicles should be much safer than human control, and there should be a dramatic decrease of fatalities and accidents, and quite possibly a more contentious population. Some people aren't very good drivers defensively or offensively. I know first hand of teenagers or young adults that total a car every year until their mid twenties and finally become more defensive of drivers due to negative experiences, this technology could eliminate all of those problems, plus eliminating pollution from vehicle emissions!
