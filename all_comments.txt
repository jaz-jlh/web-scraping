Comment: My concern about HAVs is how they will interact with emergency vehicles. Will they have the ability to detect both mechanical and electronic sirens? Will they be able to locate emergency vehicles and determine their direction and speed by doppler effect of sirens as human drivers do? Will they recognize emergency vehicles approaching if there is no audible warning, particularly unmarked vehicles and POVs with red or blue lights? Will HAVs be able to distinguish between the air horns of emergency vehicles as opposed to truckers using their air horns for emergency and non-emergency purposes? How will they distinguish between the flashing red lights of emergency vehicles and normal flashing red brake of turn signal lights? Will they be able to recognize emergency vehicles stopped in the roadway to protect active incident areas, or school buses allowing children to cross the street? How will HAVs respond when the detect an oncoming emergency vehicle, will they pull to the right and stop as some state laws require, or will they pull to the left when in a passing lane of a major highway? Will they be able to inch out of the way for emergency vehicles when traffic is stopped on the highway due to a crash ahead? Will there be a way for emergency vehicle operators to signal to HAVs how to respond in emergencies? Responding quickly and appropriately to emergencies and emergency vehicles is one of the higher level skills which drivers need. Although many drivers are distracted and perform poorly under these sudden unexpected changes, emergency vehicle operators are reasonably successful in conveying their urgency and engendering the necessary cooperation of other drivers. How do the designers plan for HAVs to perform these high level skills in times of life and death?

Comment: I anxiously look forward to a day with a self driving car and the moblitiy and economits benefits thwy will enable. My concern in the near term is the transition from human responsibilty to machine responsibility. Speaking for myeslf, once I beging to trust a technology I tend to start relying on it to do thing I once did. An example is a back up camera, for the longest time I did not look at the camera's image. Instead I would turn and look over my shoulder. Nowdays, I nearly 100% use the camera. The exception is whenthe camera is obstructed by dirt or snow. Which leads me back to my concern. Newer vehicles have multiple cameras to assist me as a driver, the more assistance they give me the more dependant Ibecome on them, and the less I rely on myself. When I think of my dirty backup camera (that I am to lazy to clean off when it is dirty), I am concerned that my other camera's are also getting dirty and can't perform thier intend purpose putting me and others in danger. The auto makers could probably use the windshield washer to clean the cameras somehow, but what about when I run out of the window cleaner? My wife's vehicle does not even notify her when the fluid is low. I like that were aiming high, but we shuld be certain the arrow is first knocked.

Comment: Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090

The exploration of developing automated or self-driving cars began in the 1920's and through the years various companies and universities have developed some sort of prototype. While innovation is a cornerstone of all developing societies, it is pertinent that innovation be kept under controlled protocols. If it were not so, then the innovators would run the gamut on creating whatever behooves them to feed self-interests that in most cases are filled with pathological idiocy. In modern times, the various innovators in the area of automated vehicles have professed interesting reasons for their pursuit of developing such vehicles. The President of Lyft, a ride-sharing service provider, indicated in an interview in the September 20, 2016 edition of USA Today that he wants to "drive community and not cars to be the center of our everyday life." Basically, it would not disturb him if the self-driving cars market were to displace workers like taxi drivers, bus drivers, parking lot attendants, auto repairmen, and auto repair shops. He wants to have an app-based-pay-as-you-go model which obviously would totally wipe out an entire segment of the banking and finance markets. That's another 4 million or more people out of work. It sounds like his idea of "community" is warped because there's no community if the people are unable to work to build up the community.

The CEO of Telsa indicated in an interview with Fortune magazine (December 21, 2015) that his ultimate goal is to have full autonomous vehicles on the road. Currently, his company has produced auto-pilot vehicles which requires the driver to have a hands-on experience. The driver of an auto-pilot enabled car is supposed to have their hands on the wheel but, apparently, that has been shown not to always be the case in video footage placed online showing some drivers even getting in the backseat while the car is on auto-pilot. Telsa's Elon Musk acknowledges in his master plan (https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux) that the cost of owning an autonomous vehicle may be out of reach for most of the masses but to make up for that he suggests that those who can't afford to own one will be able to hail a ride from his fleet of self-driving cars. So clearly his plan is to build a massive company with a bulk of civilization dependent upon his solar-powered self-driving cars. Albeit, he's correct that civilization must move away from its reliance on fossil fuel, but not at the cost of being more than 90% reliant on one company's innovation.

Google, the company who became rich over an internet search engine, has created a totally self-driving car that is designed for riding not driving, runs off an electric battery, and has sensors that supposedly detects foot traffic, cyclists, and other objects with software that classifies these objects based on their size, shape, and movement patterns. Google claims that the software even predicts what all the objects in view might do next. So, it's supposed to actually predict when a pedestrian will cross the street. What about if a child playing with a ball that goes into the street runs after it from between some parked cars? Unexpected incidents like this cannot possibly be part of the software's code. The reality is that these companies and their leaders are innovating toys for their plaything without regard to human productivity, jobs, driver safety, privacy rights, software and hardware breakdown, and the rise of artificial intelligence. Don't be foolish to think that the type of technology in these automated cars is minuscule compared to the kind of artificial intelligence that could take over from humanity. These automated vehicles are just the beginning. If the NHTSA was wise it would propagate regulations allowing for some restrictions on having total autonomous vehicles. The auto-pilot enabled model is the better choice with policy imputing responsibility upon the driver to take over when needed. The driver who wants to act irresponsibly and get in the backseat has to pay a fine just like drivers who speed over the limits. Let states have rights to intervene because it's at the local level where cars are driven.

Comment: As a 49 year old woman, I look forward to owning a self driving car. It represents future independence as I look forward to older age. I would like a completely automated car (no human intervention) that communicates with the transportation system and other cars. Thank you for considering my input.

Comment: Please work to obtain pre-market approval authority. This field of endeavor is much too fraught with potential safety hazards to allow underfunded start-ups and fly by nights to fill the roads with under tested technology to interact with the driving public it will have to share the road with for at least the first 5 decades or so. I do not much care if it serves as a barrier to startups or their equal to getting a toehold in the market. No one is allowed to sell an un-certified aircraft design and that has helped the aviation industry to achieve decent levels of safety, not that there isn't room for improvement. It might be a good idea to require a "black box" trip recorder to help accident investigators determine what happened in a crash. That might be a good idea for all new vehicles. As a driver who learned to drive in Cheboygan, Michigan, in a very snowy winter I have serious doubts about the ability of software engineers ability to anticipate all the hazards an auto is likely to encounter, especially during inclement weather. A possible strategy might be to limit early models to areas that never get snowed on or that never experience other severe weather events such as hurricanes and tornadoes. Even though I am an Electronics Engineer and dearly love technology, I am not much in favor of technology for the sake of technology. Perhaps we can define progress to mean that just because we CAN do a thing, it does not necessarily follow that we SHOULD do that thing. The preceding idea is not original with me.

Comment: NHTSA is definitely on the right path for dealing with a rapidly evolving technology. Government should help promote the growth and acceptance of technology, while providing a regulatory framework that is as flexible and innovative as the technology itself. This new approach of setting out guidelines is an admirable, and forward thinking methodology. I have a few suggestions that might be of assistance.

Don't underestimate the interaction with AI research and development. Artificial Intelligence is central to autonomous vehicles. But AI is not the whole story, there is also something called Composite Intelligence, or CI. CI, like autonomous vehicles, is already here. In fact it's been with us for quite some time. Composite intelligence is sort of half-way between human intelligence, and machine intelligence. Bank ATMs are a good example, they are a CI system. The machine does the counting, scanning, and handles the security, the human being provides decision making. Not just at the ATM, this is also true at the interbank network level, and internationally. People and machines are working together as a system. The machines do what the machines are good at, and people do what humans are good at. That's Composite Intelligence.

Without a doubt, some of the automated vehicles we're already seeing on our roads, and more we will soon be seeing, will be CI systems. The idea of the driver being in the car, but not actually driving all the time, that's also CI. As you move from Human Intelligence, toward full machine intelligence, and then to AI (AI being self aware, still many years off) we are going to pass through a sliding scale CI zone. At the start the "driver," or perhaps we should call this person sitting behind the wheel but not fully driving, the "monitor," will have to pay attention. But as the sliding scale progresses, the monitor will be able to talk on the phone, then read, and finally take a nap.

I would also suggest that NHTSA consider carving up the problem of automated vehicles in some technologically rational manner. Think about the different driving zones that exist, and the different modes. For different zones there should be different safety guidelines. For example: city streets are not limited access highways. There are residential neighborhoods, industrial neighborhoods, and different times of day, and varying weather conditions; these might be considered as different modes.

Different parts of the country also have a huge impact on the characteristics of the different driving environments. It's because terrain affects how our roads were initially engineered. The western deserts are a piece of cake: long straight highways that stretch for hundreds of miles with nary a rest stop. If we don't already have automated big rigs driving these highway zones, then something is wrong, and the developers need to step up their game. The point is this, one set of guidelines is a great start. Don't stop there! Find places where it is easier, and harder, to introduce automated vehicles. Identify the boundaries between zone, then customize your guidelines for each difficulty level. Invite industry to help you work out the details together.

Downtown traffic in New York City is probably the last place we should expect to see market penetration. Because that's probably going to require something very close to true AI. But there are lots of roads in America where automated cars and trucks could already be making a huge impact, pretty much all of rural America. Breaking the problem up helps move everything forward, technology and regulation both.

Get help from The Pentagon. The defense and aerospace industries have some amazing sensor technology. Stuff the commercial automated car folks may not even be aware of. Lots of classified stuff. Figure out how to work with them without compromising national security. I myself am currently developing full spectrum night vision. Not some grainey red or green computer generated image. Rather, a night vision experience, indistinguishable from normal daylight seeing. It's completely passive, and has zero electronics. It's purely optical technology, lenses, and mirrors. All real images operating at the speed of light, no CCD cameras, no computers. It's called "Smart Windshield Technology (TM)." In essence it is a mechanical cats eye. Even without automated cars, think how many lives could be saved if nobody ever had to drive in the dark ever again.

It's not just for humans either. Full spectrum night vision can provide software, and computers, with denser, richer, data sets.

Comment: See attached file(s)

As more fully detailed in the attached letter, we are concerned that current salesforce and consumer education about autonomous vehicle features is insufficent, and that the voluntary reporting recommended by the guidance is inadequate.

On May 10, 2014, our 16-year-old daughter was in her car, properly stopped at a red light behind another vehicle. A brand new Mercedes GL450 was coming down that neighborhood street on a test drive. The salesman did not understand the automated braking component of the adaptive cruise control system (Distronic Plus - a Level 1 autonomous feature). He had the customer set the cruise control at 40 mph in a 35 mph speed zone and told her not to touch the brakes - that the system would stop the car better than she could.

Their SUV slammed into our daughter's car at approximately 40 miles per hour, propelling her vehicle into the car stopped ahead of hers and then both of those vehicles into the active intersection. While we were fortunate that her airbags deployed and her seatbelt restrained her, she suffered a serious concussion, requiring weeks of isolation and months of therapy to regain her health. We were of course very thankful, though, because had the crash occurred even a few seconds before or after, the cars could also have been struck by crossing traffic with tragic results.

We are very aware of the wonderful potential safety benefits that increasingly automated features can bring to our roadways, and look forward to a future of more secure automotive travel. However, as our experience shows, this current situation of various manufacturers bringing a variety of different features to market can cause a lot of confusion. Moreover, there is no efficient ongoing way to ensure that data about crashes like these, brought about by confusion about autonomous features in the marketplace, are made known.

Comment: It is imperative that people continue to be able to get where they need to go via non-motorized modes. Please continue to preserve the rights and mobility of people who choose to not use motorized transportation (or cannot use it) in any subsequent law or policy.
I appreciate the attention to non-motorized users' safety in this policy and request that it remain at the forefront of all conversations about automated vehicles.

Comment: The steps in this policy to make vehicle manufacturers properly accountable for the design and implementation of the automated features of their products are an improvement on the current free-for-all. But they do not go far enough. Several critical system-level technical requirements are not adequately covered.
In my attached comments I discuss the need for NHTSA to mandate specific performance standards for operation in fault-free state and in cases where systems have reconfigured to deal with fault conditions.
I also raise four other issues: psychological perceptions of safety; need for unified approach to solutions for the Trolley Problem; need for guidance on vehicle condition with respect to its effect on system performance, and need for coordinated policies to resolve unstructured or deadlock scenarios. All of these issues require NHTSA to provide further guidance.

Executive Summary
The attached comments are made on Federal Automated Vehicles Policy for highly automated vehicles (HAVs). Comments are provided on specific suggestions and then general comments to the overall policy. The focus of my comments is from a Validation, V&V, and test practice viewpoint, which includes: systems, hardware, and software considerations. Suggestions are made for the national level but have application to international areas, since the HAV market will eventually be global in nature. Information on reference materials and follow up recommendations are included at the end of the paper.

Some 30 specific and general comments and suggests are made in the file.

Comment: Abstract

The attached note identifies five significant defects in the Vehicle Performance Guidance of the recent HAV policy and suggests changes.

Defect 1. The policy's vague description of a framework for developing and verifying complex, safety-critical software is inadequate.
Defect 2. The policy leaves each Automobile Manufacturer and NHTSA to develop separate problem definitions.
Defect 3. The "Safety Assessment letter" is dangerously incomplete.
Defect 4. Self-certification of complex, safety-critical software by developers inexperienced with such software is dangerous.
Defect 5. Vague terminology is dangerous.

Comment: I encourage NHTSA to include manufacturer testing and reporting requirements for the expected lifespan of parts in any HAV. I have seen a tremendous amount of thought put towards the safe introduction of HAVs, but frighteningly little consideration for these systems as they age. Will LIDAR and Sonar and camera systems and all sensors work just as well at 50k,100k, or 150k miles? What danger is imposed on the driving public when electronic systems begin to fail on their own, or fail to communicate properly with the mechanical systems they operate?

Additionally I encourage the Agency to include guidelines for vehicle maintenance for HAVs. Many of these proposals seem to assume "perfect world" driving scenarios. Bad weather, damaged roads, accident history, and of course poor maintenance all account for imperfect vehicles. How will an improperly maintained HAV protect its occupants and those in other vehicles around it? Will the cars not run at all until certain required maintenance and inspections are completed? What will those inspections consist of and who is responsible for them, in that case? Or perhaps they will be allowed to run and drive in badly maintained states, which could easily increase traffic incidents and fatalities due to negligence of the vehicle owner or fleet owners.

Comment: I am writing you to you regarding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's request for comments on the agency's plan for a federal automated vehicle policy [Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090] noticed on Sept. 20.

According to the NHTSA notice, "Technologies that can help drivers avoid crashes, or help vehicles themselves avoid crashes, are ushering in a new era of safety for the motoring public." These technologies require "sophisticated computer systems and software to interpret and use the data obtained by the vehicle ... to address and mitigate that overwhelming majority of crashes due to human choices or behavior."

Reducing traffic crashes involving motorcycles and decreasing the number of motorcycle operators and passengers injured or killed each year should be a top priority.

With the proliferation of advanced technologies in passenger vehicles and light trucks, I need assurances that the federal automated vehicle policy includes motorcycles as part of its plan.

As outlined in the U.S. Department of Transportation's Fact Sheet: AV Policy Section I: Vehicle Performance Guidance For Automated Vehicles, the plan includes a "15-Point Safety Assessment" to "set clear expectations for manufacturers developing and deploying automated vehicle technologies."
To ensure "clear expectations" are developed at an early stage, the NHTSA needs to test algorithms and software in vehicles to ensure that this new technology adequately and appropriately identifies and properly responds to motorcycles in all traffic situations.

Additionally, I am concerned that vehicle operators will become increasingly dependent on these devices and complacent with regard to their proficiency in operating their vehicle, subscribing to the mindset that "technology will rescue me from any bad decisions I make."

Therefore, the federal automated vehicle policy should include a consumer awareness campaign to educate the public on these new technologies.

Advanced crash-avoidance warning systems technologies used in motor vehicles must not supplant an operator's responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe and responsible manner. While technology can, and should, enhance the actions of the operator to maintain control of the vehicle, safe operation of a motor vehicle should remain the operator's highest priority.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on this important issue.

Comment: I am writing you to you regarding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's request for comments on the agency's plan for a federal automated vehicle policy [Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090] noticed on Sept. 20.

According to the NHTSA notice, "Technologies that can help drivers avoid crashes, or help vehicles themselves avoid crashes, are ushering in a new era of safety for the motoring public." These technologies require "sophisticated computer systems and software to interpret and use the data obtained by the vehicle ... to address and mitigate that overwhelming majority of crashes due to human choices or behavior."

Reducing traffic crashes involving motorcycles and decreasing the number of motorcycle operators and passengers injured or killed each year should be a top priority.

The U.S. Department of Transportation's Fact Sheet: AV Policy Section I: Vehicle Performance Guidance For Automated Vehicles, includes "Application" (applicable motor vehicles) and a "15-Point Safety Assessment" to "set clear expectations for manufacturers developing and deploying automated vehicle technologies."

My Comments:
1) The "Applications" section should specifically include motorcycles for highway operation.
2) The "15 Point Safety Assessment" should state an objective of ensuring HAV technologies, and the vehicle operators, will benefit the safety of operators and passengers of motor vehicles [including motorcycles] lacking HAV technologies of their own.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on this important issue.

Comment: I believe the 'ushering in' of electonic devices for detection and preventure is a hugh mistake. The programming for these systems are years away from being completely reliable. Only if the manufacturers and distributors are held financially and criminally liable should the use of these devices be permitted. A much smarter appoach would be to educate drivers to be a more responsive driver.

These technologies require "sophisticated computer systems and software to interpret and use the data obtained by the vehicle ... to address and mitigate that overwhelming majority of crashes due to human choices or behavior."

Reducing traffic crashes involving motorcycles, bicycles and pedestrians and decreasing the number of motorcycle operators and passengers, bicyclists and pedestrians injured or killed each year should be a top priority.

With the proliferation of advanced technologies in passenger vehicles and light trucks, I need assurances that the federal automated vehicle policy includes motorcycles, bicycles and pedestrians as part of its plan.

As outlined in the U.S. Department of Transportation's Fact Sheet: AV Policy Section I: Vehicle Performance Guidance For Automated Vehicles, the plan includes a "15-Point Safety Assessment" to "set clear expectations for manufacturers developing and deploying automated vehicle technologies."
To ensure "clear expectations" are developed at an early stage, the NHTSA needs to test algorithms and software in vehicles to ensure that this new technology adequately and appropriately identifies and properly responds to motorcycles, bicycles and pedestrians in all traffic situations.

Additionally, I am concerned that vehicle operators will become increasingly dependent on these devices and complacent with regard to their proficiency in operating their vehicle, subscribing to the mindset that "technology will rescue me from any bad decisions I make."

Therefore, the federal automated vehicle policy should include a consumer awareness campaign to educate the public on these new technologies.

Advanced crash-avoidance warning systems technologies used in motor vehicles must not supplant an operator's responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe and responsible manner. While technology can, and should, enhance the actions of the operator to maintain control of the vehicle, safe operation of a motor vehicle should remain the operator's highest priority.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on this important issue.

Advanced crash-avoidance warning systems technologies used in motor vehicles must not supplant an operator's responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe and responsible manner. While technology can, and should, enhance the actions of the operator to maintain control of the vehicle, SAFE OPERATION OF A VEHICLE REMAINS THE OPERATOR'S RESPONSIBILITY.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on this important issue.

Comment: We are writing you to you regarding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's request for comments on the agency's plan for a federal automated vehicle policy [Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090] noticed on Sept. 20.

According to the NHTSA notice, "Technologies that can help drivers avoid crashes, or help vehicles themselves avoid crashes, are ushering in a new era of safety for the motoring public." These technologies require "sophisticated computer systems and software to interpret and use the data obtained by the vehicle ... to address and mitigate that overwhelming majority of crashes due to human choices or behavior."

Reducing traffic crashes involving motorcycles and decreasing the number of motorcycle operators and passengers injured or killed each year should be a top priority.

With the proliferation of advanced technologies in passenger vehicles and light trucks, we need assurances that the federal automated vehicle policy includes motorcycles as part of its plan.

As outlined in the U.S. Department of Transportation's Fact Sheet: AV Policy Section I: Vehicle Performance Guidance For Automated Vehicles, the plan includes a "15-Point Safety Assessment" to "set clear expectations for manufacturers developing and deploying automated vehicle technologies."
To ensure "clear expectations" are developed at an early stage, the NHTSA needs to test algorithms and software in vehicles to ensure that this new technology adequately and appropriately identifies and properly responds to motorcycles in all traffic situations.

Additionally, we are concerned that vehicle operators will become increasingly dependent on these devices and complacent with regard to their proficiency in operating their vehicle, subscribing to the mindset that "technology will rescue me from any bad decisions I make."

Therefore, the federal automated vehicle policy should include a consumer awareness campaign to educate the public on these new technologies.

Advanced crash-avoidance warning systems technologies used in motor vehicles must not supplant an operator's responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe and responsible manner. While technology can, and should, enhance the actions of the operator to maintain control of the vehicle, safe operation of a motor vehicle should remain the operator's highest priority.

Comment: Regarding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090:

According to the NHTSA notice, "Technologies that can help drivers avoid crashes, or help vehicles themselves avoid crashes, are ushering in a new era of safety for the motoring public." These technologies require "sophisticated computer systems and software to interpret and use the data obtained by the vehicle ... to address and mitigate that overwhelming majority of crashes due to human choices or behavior."

What will actually happen is a massive reduction in driver skill as "technology" becomes overly relied-upon. Eventually, a human being driving their own vehicle will be considered reckless, and uninsurable.

We've already seen how Government first promotes dependence, then uses that dependence directly or indirectly against We The People.

This is another step towards technology-based slavery, where people aren't trusted to make the decisions that affect them, and the government uses the data from the technology devices to accomplish warrantless surveilance of the population. "Safety" is NOT more important than "Freedom". Free people can choose to be safe, people made "safe" by government edict can never choose to be free.

Automated/driverless vehicles must be immediately removed from service. Under no circumstances should they be allowed on public roadways. No further research to be permitted. Money to be provided for the promotion of DRIVER SKILL TRAINING.

With the proliferation of advanced technologies in passenger vehicles and light trucks, I need assurances that the federal automated vehicle policy includes motorcycles as part of its plan. Along with this I think you should consider implementing a Federal "No Lane Splitting Rule" to help ensure safety for motorcyclists.

As outlined in the U.S. Department of Transportation's Fact Sheet: AV Policy Section I: Vehicle Performance Guidance For Automated Vehicles, the plan includes a "15-Point Safety Assessment" to "set clear expectations for manufacturers developing and deploying automated vehicle technologies."
To ensure "clear expectations" are developed at an early stage, the NHTSA needs to test algorithms and software in vehicles to ensure that this new technology adequately and appropriately identifies and properly responds to motorcycles in all traffic situations.

Comment: I am writing you to you regarding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's request for comments on the agency's plan for a federal automated vehicle policy [Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090] noticed on Sept. 20.

According to the NHTSA notice, "Technologies that can help drivers avoid crashes, or help vehicles themselves avoid crashes, are ushering in a new era of safety for the motoring public." These technologies require "sophisticated computer systems aynd software to interpret and use the data obtained by the vehicle ... to address and mitigate that overwhelming majority of crashes due to human choices or behavior."

Reducing traffic crashes involving motorcycles and decreasing the number of motorcycle operators and passengers injured or killed each year should be a top priority.

With the proliferation of advanced technologies in passenger vehicles and light trucks, I need assurances that the federal automated vehicle policy includes motorcycles as part of its plan.

As outlined in the U.S. Department of Transportation's Fact Sheet: AV Policy Section I: Vehicle Performance Guidance For Automated Vehicles, the plan includes a "15-Point Safety Assessment" to "set clear expectations for manufacturers developing and deploying automated vehicle technologies."
To ensure "clear expectations" are developed at an early stage, the NHTSA needs to test algorithms and software in vehicles to ensure that this new technology adequately and appropriately identifies and properly responds to motorcycles in all traffic situations.

Additionally, I am concerned that vehicle operators will become increasingly dependent on these devices and complacent with regard to their proficiency in operating their vehicle, subscribing to the mindset that "technology will rescue me from any bad decisions I make."

Therefore, the federal automated vehicle policy should include a consumer awareness campaign to educate the public on these new technologies.

Advanced crash-avoidance warning systems technologies used in motor vehicles must not supplant an operator's responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe and responsible manner. While technology can, and should, enhance the actions of the operator to maintain control of the vehicle, safe operation of a motor vehicle should remain the operator's highest priority.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on this important issue.

Additionally, there should be mandated penalties with significant consequences to manufacturers for any accidents caused by failures of automated equipment when such failures can be shown to have contributed significantly to the accident. These penalties and consequences should increase dramatically should it be shown that such failures are a consequence of defective design or manufacture, or insufficient or fraudulent testing of the automated systems. (e.g. the current situations individually surrounding Tocotta and Volkswagen.)

Additionally, I am concerned that vehicle operators will become increasingly dependent on these devices and complacent with regard to their proficiency in operating their vehicle, subscribing to the mindset that "technology will rescue me from any bad decisions I make." It is important to understand that while motorcyclists operate vehicles that exercise and demand one's concentration, it is important to consider the long-term effects on operators of vehicles that already accommodate too many distractions and lull their drivers with a false sense of security.

Therefore, the federal automated vehicle policy should include a consumer awareness campaign to educate the public on these new technologies and/or funding to design more "motorcycle-only" commuter lanes that provide more protection from those so-called "drivers'" mental skills that will inevitably deteriorate, from "distracted" to "clinically brain-dead", as a result of their growing dependence on, and subjugation to, these technologies.

Advanced crash-avoidance warning systems technologies used in motor vehicles must not supplant an operator's responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe and responsible manner. While technology can, and should, enhance the actions of the operator to maintain control of the vehicle, safe operation of a motor vehicle should remain the operator's highest priority.

I also want to make one additional comment, having the vehicles' performance more closely monitored AND controlled by software opens up a potential for another problem, that of a vehicle's control system being hacked and controlled remotely by someone with possibly criminal intentions. A serious effort must be included to protect and secure the onboard control systems from outside interference.

Comment: I am writing you to you regarding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's request for comments on the agency's plan for a federal automated vehicle policy [Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090] noticed on Sept. 20.

---------- as a motorcyclist, i can scarcely wait for self-driving cars to supplant the stuporous dodos who are presently driving on the roads ! please speed up your processes to get this to happen . . .

According to the NHTSA notice, "Technologies that can help drivers avoid crashes, or help vehicles themselves avoid crashes, are ushering in a new era of safety for the motoring public."

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on this important issue.

Comment: I am writing you to you regarding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's request for comments on the agency's plan for a federal automated vehicle policy [Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090] noticed on Sept. 20.

According to the NHTSA notice, "Technologies that can help drivers avoid crashes, or help vehicles themselves avoid crashes, are ushering in a new era of safety for the motoring public." These technologies require "sophisticated computer systems and software to interpret and use the data obtained by the vehicle ... to address and mitigate that overwhelming majority of crashes due to human choices or behavior."

Reducing traffic crashes involving motorcycles and decreasing the number of motorcycle operators and passengers injured or killed each year should be a top priority. To say nothing of crashes with animals, pedestrians, bicycles, and other objects in the roadway. What about legal liabilities? Insurance?

With the proliferation of advanced technologies in passenger vehicles and light trucks, I need assurances that the federal automated vehicle policy includes motorcycles as part of its plan.

As outlined in the U.S. Department of Transportation's Fact Sheet: AV Policy Section I: Vehicle Performance Guidance For Automated Vehicles, the plan includes a "15-Point Safety Assessment" to "set clear expectations for manufacturers developing and deploying automated vehicle technologies."
To ensure "clear expectations" are developed at an early stage, the NHTSA needs to test algorithms and software in vehicles to ensure that this new technology adequately and appropriately identifies and properly responds to motorcycles in all traffic situations.

Additionally, I am concerned that vehicle operators will become increasingly dependent on these devices and complacent with regard to their proficiency in operating their vehicle, subscribing to the mindset that "technology will rescue me from any bad decisions I make."

Therefore, the federal automated vehicle policy should include a consumer awareness campaign to educate the public on these new technologies.

Advanced crash-avoidance warning systems technologies used in motor vehicles must not supplant an operator's responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe and responsible manner. While technology can, and should, enhance the actions of the operator to maintain control of the vehicle, safe operation of a motor vehicle should remain the operator's highest priority.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on this important issue.

Therefore, the federal automated vehicle policy should include a consumer awareness campaign to educate the public on these new technologies; AND SHOULD REQUIRE the operator to be a participant in the operation of the vehicle either through a physical connection or actual connection and check in every few seconds!

Advanced crash-avoidance warning systems technologies used in motor vehicles must not supplant an operator's responsibility to operate the vehicle in a safe and responsible manner. While technology can, and should, enhance the actions of the operator to maintain control of the vehicle, safe operation of a motor vehicle should remain the operator's highest priority.

Comment: I am writing you to you regarding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's request for comments on the agency's plan for a federal automated vehicle policy [Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0090] noticed on Sept. 20.

I have carefully read what the American Motorcycle Association has scripted and I agree with it wholeheartedly, however I would like to also add my own words (bracketed) here. The AMA script appears below that.

[I am sincerely afraid that an effort will be made to normalize all motor vehicles to conform to a specific formula in order to apply this new technology uniformly. Just the thought of automatic braking or steering on a motorcycle is alarming to me. Please respect the fact that we citizens who ride motorcycles in the US do so for reasons that may not be fathomable to the general public. Please do not take our motorcycles away, or curtail their use because they cannot conform to a common technology solution.]

According to the NHTSA notice, "Technologies that can help drivers avoid crashes, or help vehicles themselves avoid crashes, are ushering in a new era of safety for the motoring public." These technologies require "sophisticated computer systems and software to interpret and use the data obtained by the vehicle ... to address and mitigate that overwhelming majority of crashes due to human choices or behavior."
